athos remained motionless looking after him until he turned the corner of the street	1.1437005996704102

a quarter of an hour afterward the <unk> of this craft took them all aboard	1.1748902797698975
as for us we were three days without anything to eat or drink so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest when we saw <unk> <unk> we made signals of distress she perceived us made for us and took us all on board	1.8565936088562012

officer meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from england but no news arrived that was not annoying and threatening	1.334926724433899
even ali who had hastened to obey the count s summons went forth from his master s presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation and pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold while as though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over his patron s meditations whatever they were the faithful nubian walked on tiptoe towards the door holding his breath lest its faintest sound should <unk> his master s happy reverie	3.192929983139038

all i have is at his <unk> the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching <unk> even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent you are i presume m. <unk> yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it i am gaspard <unk> at your <unk> gaspard <unk> rejoined the priest	5.080273628234863

at length they reached the tent lit a lamp and while planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised d <unk> with a trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected letter	1.6219680309295654

in addition to this d <unk> possessed that invincible stock of resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart endure nothing from anyone but the king the cardinal and monsieur de <unk> he flew then rather than walked toward the convent of the carmes <unk> or rather <unk> as it was called at that period a sort of building without a window surrounded by barren <unk> accessory to the <unk> and which was generally employed as the place for the duels of men who had no time to lose	3.2264575958251953

well said he when franz had concluded what do you find to object to in all you have related	1.241949439048767
the guests were still at table and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south where unhappily for five centuries religious <unk> had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling	2.1040968894958496
what shall i do now <unk> it is finished then no not <unk> i should like to understand said porthos	1.2287514209747314

he beat a retreat toward the market but there he met planchet with his <unk> their halberds were leveled at him threateningly	1.3543226718902588

the guards under the command of m. <unk> took up their quarters at the <unk> but as we know d <unk> possessed with ambition to enter the musketeers had formed but few friendships among his comrades and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own reflections	1.7198405265808105
bazin wore his dress it may be observed with equal dignity and saintly propriety	1.2458412647247314
what would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men two <unk> do you mean yes the king and his <unk> oh	1.2972592115402222

i grasped the railings if i had relaxed my hold for a moment i should have fallen	1.2107828855514526

he clapped his hands three <unk> ordinary signal of lovers but nobody replied to him not even an echo	1.3057297468185425

here is a beautiful lawn let us go on straight <unk> <unk> wiped the perspiration from his brow but obeyed however he continued to take the left hand	1.3732048273086548
i would offer myself as your <unk> and friendly adviser said monte cristo did i not possess a moral distrust of my best friends and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too therefore in departing from this rule i should as the actors say be playing a part quite out of my line and should therefore run the risk of being <unk> which would be an act of <unk> however your excellency said andrea in consideration of lord wilmore by whom i was recommended to <unk> yes certainly interrupted monte cristo but lord wilmore did not <unk> to inform me my dear m. andrea that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one	4.611740589141846
she cast her eyes again over the note to <unk> it a second time and saw there was a postscript	1.2286837100982666
as soon as the identity of my brother was proved i was set at liberty	1.1652344465255737
the porter knew him and let him pass only calling to him in his study monsieur <unk> his study villefort pushed or rather forced the door open	1.3667041063308716
then all the members looked at each other with terror	1.0922141075134277
the old man listened attentively making a sign only that it was all so and then when d <unk> had ended he shook his head with an air that announced nothing good	1.440488338470459
grimaud seemed to him an <unk>	1.056937336921692
possibly said <unk> was not this murdered man an old <unk> <unk> yes replied the count a felon named <unk> <unk> turned slightly pale andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawing-room	1.539306640625
but to return to these <unk> true this story has diverted our attention from them	1.196303367614746
i confess i can discover no other safe and satisfactory <unk> let us see said aramis how are we to act i have arranged two plans	1.348426342010498
the count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon and offered it to morrel fixing a long steadfast glance upon him	1.3374121189117432
once across the barriers these two knew neither fatigue nor fear	1.211548924446106
he started when he saw renée for he fancied she was again about to plead for dantès	1.2101783752441406
and he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went	1.1319003105163574
but to return to what we were saying	1.074947714805603
i ask it humbly of you my lord said he sign the order for the liberation of milady de winter	1.2482391595840454

i can not leave you alone in this abominable <unk> thanks my worthy friend	1.1652781963348389

aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head	1.0705081224441528
d <unk> related to athos all that had passed at the church between porthos and the procurator s wife and how their comrade was probably by that time in a fair way to be equipped	1.4431205987930298
thus dressed she scarcely appeared thirty-five years of age	1.1346087455749512
i wish you to write from time to time to the captains in charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the <unk> and the <unk> she is at châlons <unk> the same orders for her as for the two sailing <unk> very <unk> when you have purchased the estate i desire i want constant relays of horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern <unk> your excellency may depend upon me. the count made a gesture of satisfaction descended the terrace steps and sprang into his carriage which was whirled along swiftly to the banker s house	3.7120931148529053
aramis on the contrary struck right and left and was almost delirious with excitement	1.2019001245498657
and now i think of it by heavens he may have sent the letter itself	1.177746295928955
for some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions	1.1621105670928955
the <unk> of <unk> entered on the scene	1.0568889379501343
our holy father the pope has made him a knight of jesus christ for the services he rendered to the christians in the east he has five or six rings as <unk> from eastern monarchs of his <unk> does he wear them no but he is proud of them he is better pleased with rewards given to the benefactors of man than to his <unk> he is a quaker then exactly he is a quaker with the exception of the peculiar <unk> has he any friends yes everyone who knows him is his <unk> but has he any enemies one <unk> what is his name lord <unk> where is he he is in paris just <unk> can he give me any particulars important ones he was in india with <unk> do you know his abode it is somewhere in the chaussée d antin but i know neither the street nor the <unk> <unk> are you at variance with the englishman i love <unk> and he hates him we are consequently not <unk> do you think the count of monte cristo had ever been in france before he made this visit to paris to that question i can answer positively no sir he had not because he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required and as i did not know when i might again come to paris i recommended m. cavalcanti to <unk> andrea no bartolomeo his <unk> now sir i have but one question more to ask and i charge you in the name of honor of humanity and of religion to answer me <unk> what is it sir do you know with what design m. de monte cristo purchased a house at auteuil certainly for he told me. what is it sir to make a lunatic asylum of it similar to that founded by the count of <unk> at palermo	52.06523513793945
madame replied villefort with a mournful smile i have already had the honor to observe that my father <unk> least i hope <unk> his past errors and that he is at the present moment a firm and zealous friend to religion and <unk> better royalist possibly than his son for he has to <unk> for past <unk> while i have no other impulse than warm decided preference and <unk> having made this <unk> speech villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court	3.6559195518493652
since daybreak la <unk> had been occupied with the preparations and trusting no one but himself he had visited personally the successor of pere marteau	1.429107666015625
now that never happened to us when we were four together	1.145049810409546
d <unk> was worn out with fatigue	1.0603914260864258
your ignorance on the subject therefore is easily accounted for	1.1615477800369263
have you it asked raoul <unk> is i had it <unk> the gascon making believe to find it	1.2315244674682617
a moment after <unk> s face appeared at the grating in the door	1.1113840341567993
the host fearful of consequences with the help of his servants carried the wounded man into the kitchen where some trifling attentions were bestowed upon him	1.4054433107376099
he had again missed his man who had disappeared as if by enchantment	1.1443949937820435
the fowl <unk> at the rabbit and the next day was a dead <unk>	1.1373999118804932
look at his uniform monsieur commissary look at his uniform that is true murmured the commissary <unk> that is <unk> at this moment the door was opened quickly and a messenger introduced by one of the gatekeepers of the bastille gave a letter to the commissary	1.6162059307098389
struck in the breast and extending his arms the spaniard fell back on the <unk> and the terrified horse turning around carried him off	1.3500310182571411
what encouraged me not to become your <unk> but to patronize you <unk> father s name so well known in italy and so highly honored	1.344850778579712
a dull and heavy sound was heard and the man dropped like an ox on his face and then turned over on his back	1.2665283679962158
it is a very cold one my dear friend said aramis	1.0761610269546509
do you know them fernand he said	1.0759470462799072
why did you leave the closet monsieur d <unk> asked the cardinal	1.093744158744812
this excess of bilious humor could not be attributed to play for unlike porthos who accompanied the variations of chance with songs or oaths athos when he won remained as unmoved as when he lost	1.7133049964904785
<unk> would never have left that embrace alive	1.1149851083755493
it would be <unk> too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in you	1.4764378070831299
at the bottom of that staircase lies probably the cardinal s treasury of which <unk> tell such wonders and we should only have to descend empty a chest shut the cardinal up in it double lock it go away carrying off as much gold as we could put back this <unk> over the place and no one in the world would ever ask us where our fortune came <unk> even the <unk> it would be a happy hit for clowns to make but as it seems to be unworthy of two <unk> said porthos	3.372988700866699
it was on that occasion that my ancestor <unk> de la fere was made a knight of the order of st. michael besides which the king fifteen years afterward gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen formerly in my house also a lovely specimen of workmanship	1.8858805894851685
without reckoning added monte cristo that he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in <unk> in the united states and in england but quite novel in <unk> yes yes i know what you mean <unk> railway of which he has obtained the grant is it not precisely it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that <unk> ten millions	2.195908308029175
morrel shuddered he thought he heard a sob	1.0868043899536133
the musketeers few in number not being able in the midst of this crowd to make their horses wheel around began to give way	1.3674345016479492
how could i pronounce that word	1.0819132328033447
morrel hesitated to advance he dreaded the <unk> effect of all that he saw	1.1940596103668213
soon said haydée we halted on our march and found ourselves on the borders of a lake	1.2560831308364868
i learn this desire or rather i suspect that you feel it and in order to spare you all the <unk> of a nocturnal arrival in a port and all the fatigues of landing i send one of my officers to meet you i place a carriage at his orders and he brings you hither to this castle of which i am governor whither i come every day and where in order to satisfy our mutual desire of seeing each other i have prepared you a chamber	2.8755624294281006
what have you done i have avenged myself said he	1.116080403327942
has monsieur <unk> sent anything to you for his wife or for any other person	1.1602164506912231
one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil or at least have cast down her thickly <unk> lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes but on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say if you are my friends rejoice with me for i am very <unk> as soon as the bridal party came in sight of la réserve m. morrel descended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already given that dantès should be the successor to the late captain <unk>	4.8320207595825195
i regret not having heard them	1.0669797658920288
from madame de <unk> he cried	1.0527349710464478
what have i said you said that porthos had received a sword <unk> yes but he has forbidden me so strictly to say so. and why so. zounds monsieur	1.395063877105713
i tell you so to prove to you that i still <unk> and after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count mercédès rushed up the stairs and disappeared	1.4167406558990479

keep the 50,000 francs you have <unk> give them to you	1.1183806657791138
this time the marshal charged but he was welcomed by musket shots while stones fell like hail from all the windows	1.3344706296920776
they thought he slipped as at first and the witnesses seeing he did not move approached and endeavored to raise him but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with blood	1.5468522310256958
with your lasso you could stop an ox again ali repeated his affirmative gesture	1.2512311935424805
but now you are happy doubtless replied the count since no one hears me <unk> and your present happiness has it softened your heart my present happiness equals my past misery said the count	1.5246391296386719
you are about my height pierre said he	1.1046429872512817
moreover he reckoned much on the interest of the <unk> to hush up the rumor of their own <unk>	1.253581166267395
the door opened and d <unk> went into the chamber	1.0449233055114746
this silence and this interruption in serving which were unintelligible to porthos had on the contrary a terrible meaning for the clerks	1.3277602195739746
dantès is a good fellow i like dantès	1.0605802536010742
then he placed her in the boat and as he was going to set foot in it himself athos handed him a sum of silver	1.2991881370544434
go on signor <unk> continued franz smiling at his friend s susceptibility	1.1506937742233276
doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes for the jailer said come are you going mad again dantès did not answer he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him	1.4156492948532104
but d <unk> had now slipped through the window	1.0750735998153687
d <unk> returned about eight of the clock in the morning he met villefort on his way to <unk> s room and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept	1.2974025011062622
but should you find the means of retaining them remember my lord that i shall esteem you as having rendered the greatest service that a gentleman can render to a queen and in the day of my prosperity he who brings me this order and this cross shall be blessed by me and my <unk> madame replied de winter your majesty will be served by a man devoted to you	2.19022536277771
franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage	1.192723035812378
at the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather <unk>	1.1690846681594849
indeed said d <unk> monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy	1.1619113683700562
besides we are safe for to-day you know the axiom non bis in <unk> courage sir said raoul to the wounded man	1.3251142501831055
as he had seen milady on board a vessel at the moment he was leaving england he suspected that it was almost without a doubt on account of the diamond studs	1.3605761528015137
i believe and i repeat it to your majesty that the queen conspires against the power of the king but i have not said against his <unk> and <unk> tell you against both	1.384692907333374
but touching these spanish affairs i think that the baroness did not dream the whole of the don carlos matter	1.2820247411727905
well within a week i am to deposit four millions for my share the four millions i promise you will produce ten or <unk> but during my visit to you the day before yesterday sir which you appear to recollect so well replied eugénie i saw you arranging a <unk> not that the term <unk> five millions and a half you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury and you were astonished that so valuable a paper did not <unk> my eyes like <unk> yes but those five millions and a half are not mine and are only a proof of the great confidence placed in me my title of popular banker has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions and the five millions and a half belong to them at any other time i should not have hesitated to make use of them but the great losses i have recently sustained are well known and as i told you my credit is rather shaken	8.53856086730957
i think he must have made an agreement with death to <unk> all his heirs and he appears likely to succeed	1.2616944313049316
good said d <unk> rising and brushing his knees now i have <unk> art a <unk> and the lover of madame de <unk> chapter x. monsieur porthos du vallon de <unk> de pierrefonds	1.4120690822601318

pronounced the famous i have been almost obliged to <unk> <unk> made but one bound to the antechamber and cried in a hoarse voice his excellency s horses monte cristo wrote two or three notes and as he sealed the last the steward appeared	1.6791658401489258
master <unk> the owner of a pistol and of a sword which <unk> had given him had organized a company of rogues like himself and was making a tremendous <unk>	1.427693247795105

what is this said aramis to juxon	1.0636389255523682
such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the count of monte cristo s door	1.1703766584396362
those casks which i took for casks of port wine are filled with powder	1.2057490348815918
this caused so rapid and complete a diversion from the attack that d <unk> s adversary while the latter turned round to face this shower of blows sheathed his sword with the same precision and instead of an actor which he had nearly been became a spectator of the <unk> part in which he acquitted himself with his usual <unk> muttering nevertheless a plague upon these gascons	2.4682371616363525
raoul learn how to distinguish the king from royalty the king is but a man royalty is the gift of god	1.2843199968338013

milady had likewise the best of <unk> beauty her noble appearance and the liberality with which she distributed her <unk>	1.2643954753875732
the nations took <unk> who was doomed to destroy them for a conqueror similar to other conquerors and it was necessary for both to reveal their <unk> that they might be known and acknowledged one was compelled to say i am the angel of the lord and the other i am the hammer of god in order that the divine essence in both might be <unk> then said villefort more and more amazed and really supposing he was speaking to a <unk> or a madman you consider yourself as one of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned and why not said monte cristo coldly	3.6216788291931152
if you are young i will be your comrade if you are old i will be your son	1.1530611515045166
milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did animosity	1.3593093156814575
he was with you just now	1.065860629081726
monsieur my majordomo will there be a pie i should think so <unk> as high as a <unk> you told him it was for me yes and he said he would do his best to please your <unk> good exclaimed the duke rubbing his hands	1.6491062641143799

what is the matter monsieur said planchet	1.0377477407455444
now as at the moment in which d <unk> fixed his eyes upon the gentleman in the violet doublet the gentleman made one of his most knowing and profound remarks respecting the <unk> pony his two auditors laughed even louder than before and he himself though contrary to his custom allowed a pale smile if i may be allowed to use such an expression to stray over his countenance	2.3672537803649902
could never rid himself this horse was born in the house of your father about thirteen years ago and has remained in it ever since which ought to make you love it	1.4214012622833252
if by chance our amphitryon changes his mind and receives only porthos and myself why then we must resort to heroic measures and each give two strokes instead of one	1.6221842765808105
who will support them a shudder ran through the young man s frame	1.148322343826294
come hither <unk> d <unk> who understood that it was to him this compliment was addressed approached assuming a most <unk> air	1.3275965452194214

then morrel came out from his <unk> with a beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate there was yet no one to be seen	1.3609120845794678

monte cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other when another door opened and he found himself opposite to the count of <unk> in person	1.4592561721801758
