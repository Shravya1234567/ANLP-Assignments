i have one the seal of which i am not to break till i reach london but since you tell me to whom it is addressed it is useless to wait till <unk> d <unk> tore open the envelope of the letter	45.636695861816406
a cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was as sportsmen would say keeping his hand in	90.78814697265625
oh yes i assure you count they want nothing that can render them happy they are young and cheerful they are tenderly attached to each other and with twenty-five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as <unk> <unk> thousand francs is not a large sum however replied monte cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to maximilian s heart like the voice of a father but they will not be content with that	64.95988464355469
i am so <unk> i have known a man much more unfortunate than you <unk> impossible alas said monte cristo it is the infirmity of our nature always to believe ourselves much more unhappy than those who groan by our sides what can be more wretched than the man who has lost all he loved and desired in the world listen morrel and pay attention to what i am about to tell you	69.58138275146484
raoul motioned to the host to approach threw a crown upon the table mounted his horse and posted his letter at senlis	77.95654296875
well do not you intend to bring me another plate said dantès	55.17018508911133
it was her husband who had discovered the disappearance of the moneybag and was crying thieves oh my god cried mme	50.060237884521484
d <unk> seeing him approach drew his sword a foot out of the scabbard	35.26906204223633
the cavalier entered the second hall which was guarded by the musketeers and doorkeepers	37.782676696777344
has anything particular happened in the neighborhood	124.89974212646484
have you forgotten my lord that it is he who answered for me to the queen since then monsieur de beaufort has become an enemy of the <unk> that may be my lord but since i am neither king nor queen nor minister he is not my enemy and i can not accept your <unk> this then is what you call devotion	54.96298599243164
in which the plot thickens his visit to m. de <unk> being paid the pensive d <unk> took the longest way homeward	55.274147033691406
at this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near and a bright light flashed over the room	35.74877166748047
is this that <unk> asked he after a moment of silence	42.98772430419922
then he drew from his <unk> the little emerald box raised the golden lid and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea which he placed in her hand	39.116065979003906
come you are accounted for you are here but where are your friends i do not know my lord	32.64080810546875
<unk> maximilian said the count you should not look on the graves but there and he pointed upwards	68.43722534179688
the men he beheld saw him undoubtedly for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind	111.54499053955078
you have heard what i said	39.43893814086914
then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the <unk> all was over	53.95159149169922
this news false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred evidently astonished the auditors and they retired without a word	124.71328735351562
revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her head	64.79944610595703
then he determined to go up	62.4905891418457
he waited then in the <unk> with impatience till he should be conducted to them	76.21796417236328
but can they will they receive an unhappy king who will bring such a sad story into a country already agitated by civil discord	188.71180725097656
when i returned she was married	93.82962036132812
he then laid him down on the floor where d <unk> after giving him just time enough to draw his breath gagged him with his long scarf and the moment he had done so began to undress him with the <unk> and dexterity of a man who had learned his business on the field of battle	42.880577087402344
mazarin replied d <unk> bursting into a laugh	45.79363250732422
this gentleman asks me for information which common politeness will not permit me to <unk> politeness you simpleton retorted la <unk>	70.29319763183594
beauchamp turned to look at some paintings	94.97998046875
last february you were the first who told me of the haitian funds	67.6544189453125
pardon me and then tell me how i can risk my life to serve your grace you are a brave young man said buckingham holding out his hand to d <unk> who pressed it respectfully	32.2947998046875
you see my strength fails me you see plainly i can not walk	70.52526092529297
you have received a regular letter of advice yes said <unk> but i confess i did not quite comprehend its <unk> indeed and for that reason i did myself the honor of calling upon you in order to beg for an <unk> go on monsieur	58.989036560058594
those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy him as a slave	68.56039428710938
so much the worse so much the <unk> as they say in my <unk> reverend sir i am <unk> every criminal says the same <unk> <unk> pshaw said busoni disdainfully poverty may make a man beg steal a loaf of bread at a baker s door but not because him to open a <unk> in a house supposed to be inhabited	90.62071228027344

you refuse cried the cardinal with astonishment	45.691219329833984
but apropos of debray how is it that i have not seen him lately at the baron s house there has been a <unk> what with the baroness no with the <unk> has he perceived anything ah that is a good joke do you think he suspects said monte cristo with charming artlessness	52.268165588378906
<unk> when this man is satisfied let him be <unk> <unk> remained prostrate while the count withdrew when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow before which the bandits bowed	82.77722930908203
after a second a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air and then franz heard a slight report	55.80657196044922
in which it is proved that first impulses are oftentimes the best	59.99856948852539
may i beg of you baroness to honor me with an introduction to your daughter oh you are no <unk> least not by name replied madame <unk> and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but you	85.82653045654297
for you and your <unk> this greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even porthos and this french generosity repeated by lord de winter and his friend was highly applauded except by mm	123.5551528930664
sire murmured lord leven crushed by shame sire we are ready to give you every proof of our <unk> i ask but one said the king put the army in battle array and face the <unk> that can not be sire said the earl	75.66641998291016
the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or <unk> of at certain conventional moments the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation or rouse themselves from their musings to listen to some brilliant effort of <unk> s a well-executed recitative by <unk> or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of la <unk> but that momentary excitement over they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation	143.1519012451172
the first rendezvous was fixed for the following wednesday at eight of the clock in the evening precisely	21.834095001220703
his face a little elongated had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish excitement	140.09861755371094
now my lord give me if you have not lost it the <unk> which contained the <unk> the duke took it from under his pillow and gave it to grimaud	38.93443298339844
come speak said the latter closing the door and bolting it that they might not be disturbed	42.481178283691406
you at least will be faithful to me <unk> the horse as if it understood these words bent its red nostrils toward the king s face and parting his lips displayed all its teeth as if with pleasure	91.83370971679688
if we had you my friends	66.732666015625
at the door he met the commissary of police who was waiting for him	15.003119468688965
as nine of the clock sounded d <unk> was at the place royale	20.719776153564453
in the space of half an hour we shall know the emperor s answer	39.667755126953125
i am frightful tonight she said	63.4490966796875
all this is very strange and i am curious to know how it will <unk> badly monsieur badly replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of planchet for <unk> aloud as very preoccupied people do he had entered the alley at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber	66.64423370361328
you should recognize him among a thousand say you continued he	208.27218627929688
my husband could accompany me. but do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor you have ample proof to the contrary if you look opposite said the baroness as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful greek	102.64805603027344
it was scarcely eleven of the clock in the morning and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with m. de <unk> who could not fail to think the manner in which d <unk> had left him a little cavalier	25.29961585998535
let us sit down to supper	27.846601486206055
what you ask is impossible monsieur continued he addressing faria	115.95370483398438
my father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king the cardinal and <unk> he considered the first three personages in <unk> d <unk> added m. de <unk> to the others as may be perceived but he thought this addition would do no harm	81.34363555908203
monte cristo returned to his bedroom and glancing rapidly from the garden to the street he saw first <unk> who after walking to the end of the garden fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came in	61.126678466796875
the count alone seemed <unk> more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks	59.42626953125
<unk> was where d <unk> stands	106.73123931884766
is he prosperous and happy he died a more wretched hopeless heart-broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of <unk> a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of <unk> who turned away and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head	58.303070068359375
whom do you bring asked the young girl in <unk> of monte cristo is it a friend a brother a simple acquaintance or an <unk> a friend said monte cristo in the same language	42.59724426269531
the conditions are favorable what else was opera invented for no thank you	346.98309326171875
fortunately you have the <unk> the jewel is yours my dear athos	39.20418167114258
what do you see a <unk> of how many persons twenty <unk> what sort of men sixteen pioneers four <unk> how far distant five hundred <unk> good	92.45172882080078
with folded arms he gazed for some time upon the great city	168.78245544433594
the procurator s wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine horse	51.24116516113281
besides he wore the uniform of the guards which next to that of the musketeers was most admired by the ladies	59.39366149902344
sir no and i do not know what has become of him so that i am really so unhappy that i <unk> in fact tears rolled down his cheeks	36.47219467163086
<unk> inquired franz after the countess had a second time directed her <unk> at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor <unk> why that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a living <unk> this fresh allusion to <unk> drew a smile to franz s countenance although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him	67.31688690185547
in the first place i must be satisfied that you are the person i am in search <unk> what proofs do you require did you in the year 1814 or 1815 know anything of a young sailor named dantès dantès	63.95210647583008
d <unk> examined the countenances of his companions which like that of athos wore an impression of deep anxiety and they continued their route as fast as their horses could carry them but without adding another word	64.6795425415039
you seek me sir said he	22.162641525268555
i have no influence with any one	51.20148849487305
you have seen nothing that resembles him because he works by secret springs and moves by hidden ways	212.94996643066406
keep the lieutenancy my dear keep <unk> the young man then entered the apartment of aramis	64.13301849365234
it was at the brigantine that had left in the morning and the tartan that had just set sail that edmond fixed his eyes	55.462440490722656
now they will be far from looking for us among the puritans therefore with the puritans we must <unk> good my friend good said athos	77.572021484375
a last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested it	103.42501831054688
it is kept by a friend of <unk> at last we have something definite said athos let us go to the <unk> yes answered aramis but if we are to get there we must rest our horses for they are almost <unk> aramis was right they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine they gave them three hours rest and then set off again	57.51211929321289
explain it <unk> <unk> on the question being interpreted answered three without counting <unk> d <unk> understood for while replying the captain had raised three fingers	230.61764526367188
you will excuse this poor fellow madame he said as he preceded the baroness but his orders are precise and m. de villefort begged me to tell you that he could not act <unk> in the court showing his merchandise was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions	56.687992095947266
now the scripture says positively make a sacrifice unto the <unk> that is true said his antagonists	48.17061233520508
someone had just died in the house to which that garden belonged	145.84222412109375
the mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe i do not think it would be out of keeping even at this moment	59.58434295654297
d <unk> had calculated that in not going at once to the palais royal he would give comminges time to arrive before him and consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he d <unk> and his friend had rendered to the queen s party in the morning	57.30252456665039
the prince assigned to every one his post	110.52294158935547
i could not see the expression of his countenance but i felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was placed	45.9736442565918
what do you say asked his wife pale as death	41.8194580078125
all that however has nothing to do with my obligations to you and i now come to ask you whether in my own person my family or connections i can in any way serve you	63.7132568359375
but although her <unk> full and <unk> as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained shut	186.43162536621094
will you tell me that they did not lay siege to the hôtel of the duc de la <unk> and that they did not endeavor to burn it <unk> would not perhaps have been a great misfortune in time of war seeing that it is nothing but a nest of huguenots but which is in time of peace a frightful example	56.75709533691406
i do not know said the servant but the housemaid is in mademoiselle valentine s room perhaps she has emptied <unk> ask her said morrel translating <unk> s thought this time by his look	76.515869140625
adieu raoul said the count adieu my dearest boy adieu sir adieu my beloved <unk> athos waved his <unk> dared not trust himself to speak and raoul went away his head uncovered	88.51853942871094
but the story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the donjon and even outside	50.31778335571289
the recompense will exceed your expectations that is all i promise <unk> more intrigues	126.21393585205078
he wished to speak but his tongue refused to move	62.196815490722656
he received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton nightcap in the other	43.449806213378906
i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message	72.00021362304688
oh be assured if the memory of my brother were not sacred to me you should rot in a state dungeon or satisfy the curiosity of sailors at tyburn	99.7899398803711
<unk> had disappeared without his being able to discover what had become of her	37.943180084228516
at that moment the violins sounded the signal for the ballet	55.4554328918457
well at the end of ten days you would have taken a <unk> at the end of twenty days increasing another <unk> you would have taken three hundred <unk> that is to say a dose which you would support without inconvenience and which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken the same precautions as yourself	47.26432800292969
thank you cried he throwing himself on his horse	32.212833404541016
scarron followed their movements with a glance from the corner of his eye	61.873382568359375
i am free then sir cried dantès joyfully	49.36980438232422
i succeeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre of france	39.6625862121582
on the day after the morrow by eleven of the clock the two diamond studs were finished and they were so completely imitated so perfectly alike that buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones and experts in such matters would have been deceived as he was	60.49054718017578
<unk> lingered for a moment then taking leave of old dantès he went downstairs to rejoin <unk> who awaited him at the corner of the rue senac	46.493812561035156
you will see me talking with one of my friends the abbé d <unk> of whom you have often heard me <unk> i remember him <unk> come near to us from time to time as if to speak but do not speak and do not listen	48.283931732177734
then having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything he went down again to <unk> shut the doors carefully and after convincing himself that no one was listening do you said he know anything of this young lady s illness yes said the old man	87.51146697998047
he had only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet when the procureur s footstep was heard in the passage	43.33277130126953
we should command an annuity of 175,000 livres	113.39479064941406
at the end of five hundred paces more or less they came to a rivulet which they forded	54.34980392456055
the junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the <unk> scarves whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of parisian belles	59.08224105834961
display is not becoming to everyone m. de <unk> at this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of spectators of this scene	83.99666595458984
i make the first advances said the king	21.6633243560791
but when the saddle and arms for grimaud were purchased athos had not a sou left of his hundred and fifty <unk>	91.08643341064453
she is young she is beautiful she possesses all earthly seductions	76.08375549316406
well then resumed faria with a bitter smile let me answer your question in full by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the château d if for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity and in all probability i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and <unk> dantès remained for a short time mute and motionless at length he said then you abandon all hope of escape i perceive its utter impossibility and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not <unk> nay be not discouraged	113.16053009033203
come come madame cried d <unk> seizing her hands and surveying her with an ardent glance come be more generous	43.02549743652344
all this time the soldiers were calling out stop	114.54505920410156
it is not natural for letters to enter people s houses in this manner	107.65028381347656
i have already told you father that woman under that angelic appearance had an infernal soul and when i saw her when i recalled all the evil she had done to <unk> to you	74.37846374511719
it seems however that i have unconsciously stumbled upon the <unk> still argued <unk> i would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened or at least that i had had no hand in it	63.844276428222656
the man of <unk> the crowd was caused not by the expectation of a man to be hanged but by the contemplation of a man who was hanged	36.664451599121094
in the first instance to marseilles <unk> to marseilles exclaimed the young couple	70.11583709716797
i myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these <unk> it seemed to me that i was in a dream and as it always happens in a dream i felt myself riveted to the spot	53.30031967163086
returned the influence of m. de <unk> like his own could be vastly increased and the marriage be still more suitable	111.8052749633789
copies were put up at the corners of the streets and even they who had begun to open negotiations interrupted them being resolved to await the succor so pompously announced	115.1873779296875
but after all said lord de winter when the three friends had been named we do not know who you are	36.127418518066406
in the centre of this court in the form of a horseshoe were the buildings occupied by mazarin and at each wing the pavilion or smaller building where d <unk> was confined and that level with the orangery where athos was to be	54.202510833740234
i was at school at the time and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the <unk> which would not prevent me said d <unk> if i knew where the duke of buckingham was from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the queen were it only to enrage the cardinal and if we could find means to play him a sharp turn i vow that i would voluntarily risk my head in doing <unk> and did the mercer rejoined athos tell you d <unk> that the queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter haberdasher she is afraid so. wait a minute then said aramis	73.26840209960938
haul up the cable and draw the boat to us said <unk>	71.74238586425781
ah you are quite the pet of the ladies monsieur porthos resumed the procurator s wife with a sigh	31.13316535949707
when mazarin ceased speaking he said to porthos in a low tone never tell mazarin that i understand spanish or i am a lost man and you are <unk> all right said porthos	61.88698959350586
i listen to your eminence with greatest attention replied a female voice which made the musketeer start	118.33894348144531
the last alternative seemed the most prudent so he waited until twelve of the clock	61.338714599609375
the rock yielded rolled over bounded from point to point and finally disappeared in the ocean	156.2620086669922
i am monsieur d <unk> a gascon gentleman serving in the king s musketeers	36.13928985595703
oh then let it be directly exclaimed the young man	47.580848693847656
what is this gentleman s name asked the commissary	22.016807556152344
he told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery	51.643917083740234
nay said she do not smile it ill accords with the expression of your countenance and i am sure it does not spring from your heart	37.68739318847656
monte cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary	87.11290740966797
he stopped at the door villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him then after a brief interval during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands m	40.0760498046875
the old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her	35.95820236206055
you are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in england added she with a melancholy smile and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done <unk> i am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders alas our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor incapable infirm old minister like me. well then your eminence said the queen i must inform you that charles i. my husband is on the eve of a decisive engagement	70.87759399414062
well well said monte cristo quietly i see you wish to quarrel with me but i would give you one piece of advice which you will do well to keep in mind	38.28300094604492
dantès perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by a look of grateful pleasure while mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to edmond	102.62769317626953
you are right father i understand <unk> then extending his hand towards one of the pistols he said there is one for you and one for <unk> morrel caught his hand	50.599884033203125
this harsh letter coming as it did from a man generally so polite and respectful struck a mortal blow at the pride of villefort	215.4454803466797
then he had eaten some without saying a word more <unk> therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the volga	69.0797348022461

at the same moment that he quitted the room villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door	39.04766082763672

arrived in london you will seek <unk> i must beg your eminence to observe said milady that since the affair of the diamond studs about which the duke always suspected me his grace distrusts me. well this time said the cardinal it is not necessary to steal his confidence but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a <unk> frankly and loyally repeated milady with an unspeakable expression of duplicity	76.57536315917969
he prayed and prayed aloud no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice for he fell into a sort of ecstasy	46.21748733520508

chapter <unk> the house at auteuil monte cristo noticed as they descended the staircase that <unk> signed himself in the corsican manner that is had formed the sign of the cross in the air with his thumb and as he seated himself in the carriage muttered a short prayer	58.39691925048828
two hours passed thus madame de <unk> was in a feverish sleep and the notary had arrived	39.72233581542969
down there you always had little presents and <unk> which you tried to hide from your poor friend <unk>	144.03799438476562

it was purely and simply his removal in terms clear and precise	180.25115966796875
it depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hours twelve hours or a day wherein to pay their ransom and when that time has elapsed he allows another hour s grace	106.48499298095703

now continued villefort those to whom the guilt really belongs by whom the crime was committed on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here and the certain judgment of god hereafter would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a <unk> as valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly <unk> <unk> had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame	134.83544921875
a nurse of the doctor s choice succeeded them and never left till about ten or eleven of the clock when valentine was asleep	108.55416107177734

he even opened his mouth to tell milady who he was and with what a revengeful purpose he had come but she added poor angel whom that monster of a gascon barely failed to <unk> the monster was himself	124.05736541748047
villefort became pale he understood the old man s meaning	46.57713317871094
in the meanwhile as the thing is difficult to find in france and your abbé is not probably disposed to make a journey to paris on my account i must continue to use monsieur planche s <unk> and mint and hoffman s drops are among my favorite remedies	67.09681701660156
the nurse having placed the beverage prepared by the doctor within reach of the patient and locked the door was listening with terror to the comments of the servants in the kitchen and storing her memory with all the horrible stories which had for some months past amused the occupants of the <unk> in the house of the king s attorney	49.9044075012207
it is needless to say that this caution concerned <unk> <unk> enough since it had been a useless one to grimaud	73.3811264038086
they say joy never hurts and so i came to you without any warning	193.82244873046875

the two friends mounted as did their servants	117.21591186523438

the idea of thinking ministers understand anything about princes there is something in what you have just said said beauchamp laughing	132.90487670898438

is it not worth 300,000 francs to save our father s name from the chances of evil fortune and failure i thought so replied emmanuel but i wished to have your <unk> this is my counsel <unk> accounts are made up and our bills paid all we have to do is to stop the issue of any more and close our <unk> this was done instantly	92.70476531982422
i the offspring of a noble family who placed reliance upon your <unk> was near dying of my wounds at first and of hunger afterward in a <unk> inn at chantilly without you ever <unk> once to reply to the burning letters i addressed to <unk> but monsieur porthos murmured the procurator s wife who began to feel that to judge by the conduct of the great ladies of the time she was wrong	91.31700897216797
to form the slightest idea of his feelings one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its <unk> eyes raised to heaven	89.93690490722656
the very dogs that wander <unk> and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread and that a man a christian should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves christians is too horrible for belief	124.63349914550781
the woman s lips seemed to move as though she were talking but because she merely spoke in an undertone or my senses were dulled by sleep i did not catch a word she uttered	88.06800842285156
after breakfast it was agreed that they should meet again in the evening at athos s lodging and there finish their plans	60.08320236206055

madame de villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girl s heart	59.496612548828125
this time however his address although polite was cooler than usual	164.89651489257812
one fact more than the rest brought his friend sinbad the sailor back to his recollection and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors and <unk> s account of <unk> s having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen reminded franz of the two corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht which had even deviated from its course and touched at <unk> for the sole purpose of landing them	85.86672973632812
to this dumb language which was so unintelligible to others she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid whose body could scarcely be called a living one but who nevertheless possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses	166.8244171142578
he placed his hand on his dagger and stopped	32.8388786315918

well done <unk> cried the cardinal to the equestrian i see plainly that notwithstanding the sixty-four years that have passed over your head you are still the same man active and zealous	81.61163330078125
in consequence of this feeling of repugnance he was about to pass without speaking to him but as he had done the day before m. <unk> accosted him	27.021800994873047

keep your <unk> at home in your money boxes or since you have clerks whom you pay vent it upon <unk> not so replied <unk> your advice is wrong so i shall not follow it	124.072509765625
the grating against the <unk> aroused the young girl from the stupor in which she was plunged and which almost amounted to insensibility	56.98605728149414
but you expected some one then asked the officer	70.30757904052734

hold your tongue stupid fellow said d <unk> and laying hold of the casement he let himself gently down from the first story which fortunately was not very elevated without doing himself the slightest injury	81.95891571044922
he would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart and by their union constitute a passion so strange and as it were diabolical	92.67365264892578

in consequence he brought them the key of his <unk> least such was the apparent motive of his visit	59.99359130859375
however among all the incoherent details given to me by the abbé busoni and by lord wilmore by that friend and that enemy one thing appears certain and clear in my <unk> in no period in no case in no circumstance could there have been any contact between him and me. but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe	142.3391876220703
you can not for a moment imagine d <unk> that i would commit such an offense <unk> the unknown giver interrupted d <unk>	39.74675750732422

dantès told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking and the jailer went <unk> to fetch another without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken one	60.281158447265625

oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although i did not myself believe it i would not for the world have destroyed my father s faith	63.41023635864258
a <unk> yes i think i received a <unk> upon my <unk> brutes said d <unk>	24.4495849609375
she received him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages	61.2862663269043
a letter said the young man	17.62247657775879
then she threw herself upon her knees and began to pray	33.103546142578125
<unk> collected a store of crusts bazin who had always been inclined to devotion never quit the churches planchet watched the flight of flies and grimaud whom the general distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his master heaved sighs enough to soften the stones	130.41041564941406
and how does m. de villefort bear it as usual	67.3101806640625
albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day	106.300537109375
the races like the <unk> are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the carnival	57.92133712768555
the king took it with a trembling hand looked for the address which was wanting became very pale opened it slowly then seeing by the first words that it was addressed to the king of spain he read it rapidly	85.95779418945312
the duke looked at this strange figure with surprise	37.7852897644043
i have pledged my last jewels sold your clothes and my own to pay his servants who refused to accompany him unless i made this sacrifice	111.41416931152344
really madame he said did i alarm you much oh no sir she answered but you know things impress us differently according to the mood of our <unk> villefort forced a laugh	127.1307144165039
he reflected that this coalition of four young brave enterprising and active men ought to have some other object than swaggering walks fencing lessons and practical jokes more or less witty	68.48371124267578
i was as i told him resolved to die of hunger	55.811492919921875
the old marshal turned toward the viscount grateful for that praise of his son whilst the prince exclaimed the young man is right let the prisoner be brought in. meanwhile the prince took de guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had been taken and who this young man was	138.8062744140625
now sir pray do not be offended at the question i am about to put to you as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron	44.02211380004883
and now go <unk> before i go said mordaunt i have some questions and a favor to ask you <unk> a favor from me mordaunt bowed	82.69071197509766
but no one entered except two or three marines who brought her trunks and packages deposited them in a corner and retired without speaking	81.1523666381836
i must absolutely see it i shall find a <unk> no nonsense <unk> i will offer myself as <unk> the rooms are all <unk> well then i must be contented to imagine <unk> that is the best plan believe me. try at least to give me an idea of what it <unk> how can i nothing is easier	81.29097747802734
at a distance albert thought it was a complete suit for he counted from the ace to the ten	85.89360046386719
he was therefore silent and as athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth d <unk> s confidence stopped there	95.71605682373047
when a thing suited him he paid the price demanded without thinking to ask for any abatement	162.3255615234375
you understand this do you not my most precious wife	64.20268249511719
what is this wait your reverence there is a <unk> you know i have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalier i will break every bone in your body	49.37561798095703
so that you see there is a deadly feud between <unk> but said the envoy you do not go about it in the right way to kill him if i understand you <unk> aw said the englishman i practice shooting every day and every other day <unk> comes to my <unk> this was all the visitor wished to ascertain or rather all the englishman appeared to know	56.742942810058594
the following day about three of the clock a single blow struck on the gong summoned ali to the presence of the count	32.16206741333008
raised to the height of twenty feet so as to be on a level with the window it had two lower stories	83.22981262207031
for a mind so <unk> as that of d <unk> this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better future	84.06261444091797
he fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned him	25.90567970275879
they then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for milady	67.25531768798828
living you would feel shame at my name dead you may raise your head and say i am the son of him you killed because for the first time he has been compelled to break his <unk> the young man uttered a groan but appeared resigned	68.12898254394531
he remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to breathe	74.09371948242188
all this is perhaps <unk> insanity but tell me what woman has a lover more truly in love what queen a servant more ardent my lord my lord you invoke in your defense things which accuse you more strongly	170.00624084472656
but you do not know us when we can not have one thing we invent <unk> and have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody only to our host	84.69135284423828
besides you are right in another respect which is in thinking that if we were to meddle in politics there could not be a better time than the <unk> how can you know that	50.38152313232422
mercédès had no fire in that cold and naked <unk> who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house from the hall to the boudoir she had not even one little <unk> whose apartment had been a conservatory of costly exotics	79.15485382080078
in the chamber of d <unk> and porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and gagged	39.25604248046875
ah monseigneur continued <unk> throwing himself at his eminence s feet ah how truly you are the cardinal the great cardinal the man of genius whom all the world reveres the cardinal however contemptible might be the triumph gained over so vulgar a being as <unk> did not the less enjoy it for an instant then almost immediately as if a fresh thought has occurred a smile played upon his lips and he said offering his hand to the mercer rise my friend you are a worthy <unk> the cardinal has touched me with his hand	91.40570831298828
the conversation took place in <unk> language which d <unk> could not understand but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful englishwoman was in a great rage	60.49740982055664
how sir said planchet is it you eh	68.98799133300781
athos collected himself and in proportion as he did so d <unk> saw that he became pale	57.59684371948242
i am entirely at your service except only for my <unk> thank you sir what i am about to ask will not compromise you in any <unk> if it should even compromise me a little said monsieur de comminges with a smile still make your demand	71.64704132080078
he touched him on the shoulder	28.208980560302734
<unk> he looked at aramis and made a special sign to him with his head	28.92670249938965
he reached the instrument he had placed on the stand touched a spring and immediately a pale light just bright enough to render objects distinct was reflected on his hands and countenance	125.0699462890625
after a moment i fancied that i felt a slight pulsation of the heart and as i had been assistant at the hospital at bastia i did what a doctor would have <unk> inflated the lungs by blowing air into them and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it began to breathe and cried feebly	52.6374626159668
alas sir exclaimed barrois a great misfortune has happened	60.25172805786133
one of those three members was the coachman who had driven them there	79.39485168457031
what appears to you to emanate from a celestial source seems to me to proceed from one far less pure	92.31420135498047
and he is in paris continued he addressing raoul then turning to the queen we may still hope	74.19631958007812
they were assembled in council at the residence of athos which always indicated an event of some gravity	97.07476043701172
make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description and when you have met with an eligible spot visit it and if it possess the advantages desired purchase it at once in your own name	101.5622329711914
in consequence i embarked for oran and went from thence to constantine where i arrived just in time to witness the raising of the siege	63.822025299072266
in case of any attempt to escape the penalty of death is to be applied	44.36671447753906
beauchamp my good fellow you know i am starving said debray do not set him off on some long <unk> well i do not prevent your sitting down to table replied beauchamp <unk> can tell us while we eat our <unk> gentlemen said <unk> it is only a quarter past ten and i expect someone <unk> ah true a diplomatist observed debray	81.89386749267578
on the morning of the eighth day bazin fresh as ever and smiling according to custom entered the cabaret of the <unk> as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast saying as had been agreed upon monsieur aramis the answer from your <unk> the four friends exchanged a joyful glance half of the work was done	107.69371795654297
i can not tell you how long we remained in this state at that period i did not even know what time meant	50.52040481567383
during the whole of this nocturnal ride during the whole time that he was endeavoring to understand the various characters of comminges <unk> and <unk> mazarin was in truth studying more especially one man	90.90011596679688
certainly and why should i regret what gives you pleasure oh	188.700927734375
they began by walking through the apartments many of which were fitted up in the eastern style with cushions and divans instead of beds and pipes instead of furniture	94.15226745605469
well said maximilian death came a third time and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a word	78.94911193847656
how they must be asking where is the cardinal what has become of the minister where has the favorite gone how they must be looking for monseigneur in all corners	130.7698974609375
in an hour inquired <unk> turning pale	85.14737701416016
you want to know how we came here	47.26863098144531
english and french the hour having come they went with their four lackeys to a spot behind the luxembourg given up to the feeding of goats	179.9314422607422
is it as good now oh yes replied andrea laughing	69.4798583984375
i suffered that is <unk> yes said mazarin as women suffer in avenging themselves	127.0341796875
oh you encourage me and something tells me there placing his hand on his heart that i ought to have no secret from <unk> you are right morrel god is speaking to your heart and your heart speaks to you	57.18067932128906
enough enough replied <unk> say no more about it i will take all the consequences upon <unk> and he began his story	96.30265045166016
well said the latter a young woman of about twenty-six or twenty-eight years of age and a man of from thirty-five to forty have indeed lodged at the two houses pointed out by your eminence but the woman left last night and the man this <unk> it was they cried the cardinal looking at the clock and now it is too late to have them pursued	68.51346588134766
milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions	110.30723571777344
at the same moment a violent crash was heard and cries of distress	17.5057315826416
reflect how glorious a day it will be how grand how solemn that day of complete restoration on which you will say in this very office my father died because he could not do what i have this day done but he died calmly and peaceably because in dying he knew what i should <unk> my father my father cried the young man why should you not live if i live all would be changed if i live interest would be converted into doubt pity into hostility if i live i am only a man who has broken his word failed in his <unk> fact only a bankrupt	137.15621948242188
the man who had the appearance of being a butcher descended a little steep and isolated street looking on to the river with two of his friends	48.92909622192383
for a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven	134.8621368408203
the two kingdoms are so near that france must be interested in our situation as we are interested in that of france	73.58757781982422
this time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to dantès and seeing that he received no reply go to the bed and thus discover all	73.4327163696289
i fear i shall be forced to suspend <unk> have you no friends who could assist you morrel smiled mournfully	66.04862213134766
for you monsieur said planchet presenting the billet to the young man	40.396488189697266
this is not the hôtel des <unk> come you are growing discontented you are no longer happy you who only wish to live like a retired <unk> <unk> sighed	59.645172119140625
what do you say of him	11.299195289611816
you will allow me to leave first then after half an hour you can go away in your <unk> yes monseigneur	41.73301315307617
i recognize grimaud by his long legs and his determined slouch	156.97447204589844

this is the fourth which you have let fall and i have picked up for in three years madame i have only seen you four <unk> first which i have described to you the second at the mansion of madame de chevreuse the third in the gardens of <unk> duke said the queen blushing never speak of that <unk> oh let us speak of it on the contrary let us speak of it	54.964141845703125

in whose name do you come said he to him	41.51396560668945
poor fellow remarked <unk> affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart	65.51368713378906
the curate then entered followed by planchet	91.01814270019531
maximilian maximilian he said the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a <unk> oh do not fear my friend said morrel raising his head and smiling with a sweet expression on the count i shall no longer attempt my <unk> then we are to have no more <unk> more despair no i have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a <unk> poor fellow what is it my grief will kill me of <unk> my friend said monte cristo with an expression of melancholy equal to his own listen to me	52.62004470825195
athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawing-room where there were several people	38.996185302734375
d <unk> was again in the presence of the circe who had before surrounded him with her enchantments	32.77535629272461
why do you remember when it forgets	56.326473236083984
aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head	34.534664154052734
it was indeed madame <unk> and her daughter whom valentine had seen they had been ushered into madame de villefort s room who had said she would receive them there	40.07831573486328
the natural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between the city and the mountains between civilized and savage life	78.96029663085938
well come set <unk> ah sir you are going to save my life a second time cried planchet	49.55702590942383
he waited silently striving to pierce through the darkness	71.07473754882812
it was a pledge a remembrance	78.57662200927734
this is all i can say sir if you wish to learn more address yourself to m. de <unk> the inspector of prisons no	37.24789047241211
we may well pity the poor fellows said the abbé	70.08869934082031
he not only talked much but he talked loudly little caring we must render him that justice whether anybody listened to him or not	243.501220703125
planchet said d <unk> i am going out for all day perhaps	43.34635925292969
the salutation was so well understood that morrel with the same expression in his eyes placed his handkerchief to his mouth and these two living statues whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect separated from each other by the whole length of the room forgot themselves for a moment or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation	78.07618713378906
porthos opened his mouth to reply d <unk> made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually closed	45.06972885131836
the count took another spoon and again dipped it into the golden box	71.24238586425781
in this kind of game not to kill is to let one s self be killed	102.6803207397461
ask yourself wherefore after rescuing the infant from its living grave you did not restore it to its mother	198.72427368164062
my <unk> what weapons my military <unk> yes my lord at any rate i think so. make sure of it and if they want it have them burnished up	97.2184066772461
now gentlemen said he conduct me where you <unk> turning back again he said i thought i saw winter move if he still lives by all you hold most sacred do not abandon <unk> never fear king charles said mordaunt the bullet pierced his <unk> do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or porthos said d <unk> to athos and aramis that you recognize this man for milady is not dead her soul lives in the body of this <unk> the detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive but on the road an aide-de-camp from cromwell sent orders that colonel <unk> should conduct him to <unk> castle	110.00578308105469
everybody looked and listened with astonishment comprehending nothing of what passed	97.83253479003906
how i worked how i hoped how i struck every piece of turf thinking to find some resistance to my spade	316.04229736328125
in an instant from the door of the cabinet to the street gate the whole hôtel was boiling	33.16062545776367
we let them tell their story out replied <unk>	124.25640106201172
mazarin wrote a few words which he gave to this man then he bowed	60.86949920654297
a gentleman has but his word and i have given you <unk> with a heavy heart d <unk> again bent his way toward the ferry	62.74764633178711
a violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock two more forced out the bolts and the broken door fell in	138.30020141601562
what brings you to paris affairs of importance which you shall know later	126.92288970947266
this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled organs	53.607177734375
the frenchman threw her a bouquet teresa returned <unk> this with the consent of the chief who was in the <unk> what cried franz was luigi <unk> in the carriage with the roman peasants it was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied peppino	97.16256713867188
within two leagues of this place at the inn of the red <unk> in that case i am lost said d <unk>	41.69313430786133
make use of it then whenever you think it will be most useful for my eldest son s welfare	91.15569305419922
ten minutes sufficed for their defeat and d <unk> remained master of the field of battle	53.09080123901367
why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited	75.20660400390625
he knows my tastes my caprices my wants	246.3503875732422
therefore leaving directions at every place for grimaud they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the lys	98.68695068359375
we will accept them the more readily since we have them not here you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the <unk> de <unk> at marseilles	51.540626525878906
we are judges of wounds we old soldiers athos added smiling	323.265625
she had many a time felt humiliated by the self-sacrifice and disinterestedness shown by the gascon gentleman	88.81880950927734
what has happened to you today to raise all these melancholy ideas this wound my dear d <unk> has been a warning to me from <unk> this wound	65.70734405517578
we avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes the choice is <unk> it is true but in everything friend one must always return to the same <unk> stupid one i admit but very <unk> you any money something like a hundred <unk> that my farmer sent to me the day before i left <unk> but out of that sum i ought to leave fifty for <unk> young man must live respectably	119.17033386230469
he must be <unk> do not attempt it he has revenged himself and has done well	68.65457916259766
d <unk> then remembered the injunction if you value your own life or that of those who love you remain motionless and as if you had seen <unk> he stopped therefore trembling not for himself but for the poor woman who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this rendezvous	110.27531433105469
then you know the men who are now on monte cristo oh yes we sailors are like freemasons and recognize each other by <unk> and do you think we have nothing to fear if we land nothing at all smugglers are not <unk> but these two corsican bandits said franz calculating the chances of peril	64.8909683227539
are you also in accord with spain and england with madame de chevreuse and the queen sire replied the cardinal sighing i believed myself secure from such a <unk> monsieur cardinal you have heard me i will have those <unk> there is but one <unk> what is that that would be to charge monsieur de séguier the keeper of the seals with this mission	57.51689529418945
however they left the castle behind that was the principal thing	131.55111694335938
it was that paper you read this morning read it again dantès and then i will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected <unk> faria with an air of triumph offered the paper to dantès who this time read the following words traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust this 25th day of april 1498 be alexander <unk> and fearing that not he may desire to become my heir and re and bentivoglio who were poisoned my sole heir that i have bu and has visited with me that is in island of monte cristo all i poss jewels diamonds gems that i alone may amount to nearly two mil will find on raising the twentieth ro creek to the east in a right line	121.38396453857422
one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil or at least have cast down her thickly fringed lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes but on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say if you are my friends rejoice with me for i am very <unk> as soon as the bridal party came in sight of la réserve m. morrel descended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already given that dantès should be the successor to the late captain <unk>	98.0644302368164
then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too	85.11656188964844
i tell you marquis my fortune is made if i only reach the tuileries the first for the king will not forget the service i do <unk> in that case go and get ready	74.3309555053711
and now he said when he saw that dantès had read the last line put the two fragments together and judge for <unk> dantès obeyed and the <unk> pieces gave the following <unk> this 25th day of april 1498 be ing invited to dine by his holiness alexander <unk> and fearing that not content with making me pay for my hat he may desire to become my heir and re serves for me the fate of cardinals caprara and bentivoglio who were poisoned i declare to my nephew guido spada my sole heir that i have bu ried in a place he knows and has visited with me that is in the caves of the small island of monte cristo all i poss <unk> of ingots gold money jewels diamonds gems that i alone know of the existence of this treasure which may amount to nearly two mil lions of roman crowns and which he will find on raising the twentieth ro ck from the small creek to the east in a right line	85.56721496582031
d <unk> was acquainted with <unk> having gone thither with the court on several occasions for at that time <unk> was a royal residence	65.35182189941406

there said la <unk> as she placed a bottle of wine on the table supper is ready whenever you <unk> and you asked joannes	63.40403747558594
comminges looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of <unk> appearing at the window of the second floor	39.72088623046875
an adventure on the high road	81.33964538574219
scratches himself inquired the duke what does your majesty mean yes indeed my dear duke	136.85440063476562
without your aid continued he repeating the count s words i should have been a dead <unk> <unk> my antagonist took flight replied de guiche and left me at liberty to come to your assistance	76.28072357177734
peppino walked with a firm step doubtless aware of what awaited him	126.88126373291016
when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried a carbine presented arms after the manner of a sentinel and cried who comes there in sardinian	100.87513732910156
the young woman spoke with an expression of deep tenderness while the count replied with an air of gentle gravity	28.05304527282715
now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of hercules were <unk> he went to find aramis	84.48149108886719

having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation the count making a signal to ali to follow him went out by the <unk> and on reaching the bois de boulogne turned apparently without design towards paris and at twilight found himself opposite his house in the champs-élysées	89.50616455078125

between the court and the garden built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture was the large and fashionable dwelling of the count and countess of <unk>	58.805362701416016
the twenty men marched straight toward the barrier but from behind the beams from among the <unk> and from the heights of the rocks a terrible fusillade burst forth and at the same time planchet s <unk> appeared at the corner of the cemetery of the innocents and <unk> s bourgeois at the corner of the rue de la monnaie	29.589313507080078
it was forty-eight hours since i had taken any nourishment	35.95377731323242

presently the door opened and she perceived felton	64.52715301513672
i will go <unk> then he descended a smile on his lips and murmuring that last word of human philosophy perhaps but instead of the darkness and the thick and <unk> atmosphere he had expected to find dantès saw a dim and bluish light which as well as the air entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks	55.22875213623047

follow me sir and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted him by a <unk> passage to another entrance	132.9322509765625
the englishman easily found the entries relative to the abbé faria but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond dantès	101.89830017089844
if you have been culpable it was imprudence and this imprudence was in obedience to the orders of your captain	53.56306457519531
you know the proverb unlucky at play lucky in <unk> you are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its revenge	84.78303527832031
athos whose keen eye lost nothing perceived a faintly sly smile pass over the lips of the young gascon as he replied we had a short discussion upon <unk> and you aramis asked athos	74.9454116821289
he is <unk> villefort drew back a few steps and clasping his hands exclaimed with real amazement and sympathy dead <unk> so soon too yes it is very soon said the doctor looking at the corpse before him but that ought not to astonish you monsieur and madame de <unk> died as soon	78.5133285522461

he will set out upon receiving an order from me without knowing what he carries and he will carry your majesty s letter without even knowing it is from your majesty to the address which is on <unk> the queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion gazed at her as if to read her very heart and seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes embraced her tenderly	58.334190368652344

it is even probable that i shall have to make a journey	35.12748336791992
fortunately the mariners were used to these latitudes and knew every rock in the tuscan archipelago for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without <unk> had long since disappeared and monte cristo itself was invisible but the sailors seemed like the lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation	82.84727478027344
then he looked anxiously at valentine	39.7789421081543
he would extinguish the sun if the sun <unk> him	117.55398559570312
the count must feel sure that franz recognized him and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them	105.18545532226562

you will find good cigars on the centre table	123.64379119873047
juxon was waiting for him impatiently	75.5106430053711
it was not difficult to conquer as she had hitherto done men prompt to let themselves be seduced and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her net	131.8921661376953
and therefore when all paris was rejoicing in the expected return of the king appointed for the next day <unk> alone in the midst of the general happiness was dissatisfied he sent for the two men whom he was will not to summon when in especially bad humor	83.90219116210938

he replied in monosyllables and athos and aramis looked significantly at one another	69.14973449707031
not for the countess or for albert said monte cristo a dead father or husband is better than a dishonored one <unk> washes out <unk> poor countess said maximilian i pity her very much she is so noble a woman pity albert also maximilian for believe me he is the worthy son of the countess	157.16552734375
the noble and distinguished air of athos those flashes of greatness which from time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant companion in the world that forced and cynical gaiety that bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the rarest <unk> qualities attracted more than the esteem more than the friendship of d <unk> they attracted his admiration	73.20442199707031

it appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her besides the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested <unk> injury is repugnant to every mind	125.14905548095703
you will charge <unk> to report it	69.63993072509766

one evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at leghorn wrapped himself in his coat and lay down and said to the crew to the island of elba the boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning franz disembarked at <unk>	51.003211975097656

the governor of the <unk> was monsieur du tremblay the brother of the famous capuchin joseph that fearful favorite of richelieu s who went by the name of the gray cardinal	51.8177604675293
the major seated himself therefore by the side of <unk> who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son 60,000 francs a year might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500,000 or 600,000 livres	50.55794143676758

the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal and one of them passing under d <unk> s arm entered and broke a mirror in which porthos was complacently admiring himself	37.90438461303711

a light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor	53.700191497802734
m. de <unk> would doubtless give him good advice as to the whole affair	51.47154235839844
it was then into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young man advanced with a beating heart ranging his long rapier up his lanky leg and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap with that <unk> of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face	58.219947814941406

then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when i saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches deep	129.3491668701172
on arriving at the king s private antechamber m. de <unk> found la <unk> who informed him that they had not been able to find m. de la <unk> on the preceding evening at his hôtel that he returned too late to present himself at the louvre that he had only that moment arrived and that he was at that very hour with the king	30.845903396606445

in short he had reached that supreme moment when the bravest feel a shudder in their veins when suddenly in the direction of the rue de l <unk> the crowd opened crying long live the coadjutor and <unk> in surplice and cloak appeared moving tranquilly in the midst of the fusillade and bestowing his benedictions to the right and left as undisturbed as if he were leading a procession of the fete dieu	72.44114685058594

what do you want with me my friend said aramis with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the church	46.068138122558594
sir cried morrel seizing the moist hand of the paralytic they ask me who i am and what right i have to be here	71.79238891601562
he opened at once his little eyes and his great mouth to inhale better the joke his eminence deigned to address to him and ended by a burst of laughter so violent that his great limbs shook in hilarity as they would have done in an ague	82.49691009521484
their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages	120.12493133544922
the young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his neighbor	39.316104888916016
there are only fifteen feet more from the top down here and the grass is <unk> the duke had already begun to descend	62.058441162109375
this embarrassment had completely escaped albert but it caused lucien to shorten his visit he was evidently ill at ease	189.2681884765625
stop and let us <unk> talking with you brings me misfortune said porthos	95.131591796875
yes sir replied julie with hesitation what is your pleasure	63.81399154663086
you have come then at last	36.110137939453125
as a further precaution they had bound his hands	113.65008544921875
i have more than once intended witnessing an execution but i have never been able to make up my mind and you albert i replied the viscount i saw castaing executed but i think i was rather intoxicated that day for i had quitted college the same morning and we had passed the previous night at a <unk> besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at paris that you should not see one anywhere else when you travel it is to see everything	70.05689239501953
his eminence will continue to be prime minister and her majesty s favorite if he will grant to me and my friends what we demand for france and for <unk> occupy yourselves with your own affairs gentlemen and let france settle matters as she will with me resumed mazarin	109.46598815917969
at twelve this man was replaced by another functionary and <unk> wishing to catch sight of his new guardian approached the door again	93.11563873291016
ah said valentine the thing you desire begins with the letter n it is with n that we have to do then	84.63096618652344
the two oarsmen bent to their work and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the quai d orléans	43.655677795410156
he preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage then suddenly <unk> his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it he mounted and galloped off in the direction of paris	82.0990219116211
but i too have had the idea you have and two or three times the same fancy has come over me but i have always given it up	56.05951690673828
now sir said albert if you think my apology sufficient pray give me your hand	123.68559265136719
you see then felton i can do nothing but die	63.67459487915039
as he gained the top of the rue <unk> he saw two persons coming out of the rue dauphine whose appearance very much struck him	71.91405487060547
well he asked that will do will it not yes my lord on one <unk> what that grimaud shall wait on us at <unk> nothing could be more agreeable to the duke however he had presence of mind enough to exclaim to the devil with your grimaud	134.6075897216797
speak said athos we can not see your signs	60.43095779418945
yours is a noble <unk> he said here is your <unk> raoul bent his knee to the ground	50.880977630615234
this time maximilian was the first to arrive	55.53770446777344
then the demigod vanished he remained scarcely a man	104.67839813232422
at length she rallied drew aside the curtain and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on valentine	83.97820281982422
it is an axiom of criminal law and consequently you understand its full <unk> <unk> sir continued villefort there is something to fear besides death old age and madness	82.30083465576172
it would be exceedingly <unk> the gascon with his vivid imagination had already seen the advantage to be derived from his situation	42.900211334228516
my first impulse on coming to myself was to feel under my pillow for the knife i had not been able to reach if it had not been useful for defense it might at least serve for expiation	74.7637710571289
the poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts and i found myself in the house	120.6275863647461
monsieur he said after a moment they tell me great things of you	50.402610778808594
they will know you are deserted and think you also poor for i alone know your real financial position and am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest <unk> the dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this was equalled by the calm indifference with which debray had spoken	108.45704650878906
but to return to what you were saying <unk> well do you know why they die so <unk> at m. de villefort s <unk> is good said <unk>	36.59536361694336
good said he as he went away this is a fruitful soil and i feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren <unk> next morning faithful to his promise he sent the prescription requested	90.57475280761719
go now at once or i shall have you put <unk> i looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further entreaty	63.825252532958984
five minutes elapsed during which franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the campagna and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion	53.456207275390625
d <unk> immediately placed the point of his sword at his throat	27.023191452026367
but said he did you observe one very singular thing what how attentively he looked at <unk> at me <unk> albert reflected	105.67707824707031
then all his suspicions were confirmed the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the forest	54.00050354003906
the family began to get accustomed to their obscurity	91.17477416992188
madame he said you have wished to conquer the prince your <unk> is to say the greatest captain of the age and when women of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it	73.34844970703125
well of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the masters for which we will draw lots	70.61302185058594
nothing nothing only shut the window	169.9511260986328
and the four friends rushed out of the fort gained the field of battle picked up the four muskets of the privates and the <unk> of the brigadier and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till they reached the city turned again toward the bastion bearing with them the trophies of their victory	53.906307220458984
the captain was only waiting for his passengers hardly had they put foot on deck ere her head was turned towards hastings where they were to disembark	69.47313690185547
<unk> therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task	141.8284149169922
well now i have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this little madame <unk> who is that her <unk> what is his name oh your eminence knows him well cried milady carried away by her anger	68.08487701416016
this chamber was a sort of garret situated in the rue des <unk> near the luxembourg	22.17682647705078
you have a quick ear monsieur athos said the cardinal but now listen to this	65.75460815429688
as for denying that i am your nephew you will think twice about it now that i have learned some things of which i was ignorant a year <unk> and how does it concern me what you have learned said de winter	50.62935256958008
ah captain said the officer everything is quiet <unk> i did not know that something is going on in yonder house and he pointed to a magnificent hotel situated on the very spot whereon the vaudeville now stands	72.70848083496094
count he said you are not the same here as in <unk> how so here you <unk> the count s brow became clouded	60.54722213745117
however what had you to say to me he resumed let us return to that <unk> with pleasure replied d <unk> i must however first frankly tell you that you must change your mode of <unk> how go into harness again gird on your sword run after adventures and leave as in old times a little of your fat on the <unk> ah	95.03252410888672
there as in every spot where monte cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease	119.61388397216797
monte cristo saw nothing but the shadow which no one else observed	81.43627166748047
there was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night but each of those strokes which made up the expected hour vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man	36.27680587768555
i have four harriers which are considered the swiftest in the county and a pack of hounds which are unequalled for twenty leagues <unk> and porthos heaved another sigh	56.039310455322266
on the right and on the left of the road which the dismal procession pursued appeared a few low stunted trees which looked like deformed dwarfs crouching down to watch men traveling at this sinister hour	71.58990478515625
i promise you it affords <unk> as little pleasure to revive it as it does you	126.10859680175781
thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words tomorrow sir i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on <unk> and i sir said <unk> shall be most happy to receive <unk> upon which he offered to take cavalcanti in his carriage to the hôtel des princes if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son	62.69019317626953
besides the count will be in his own house and only see them when he thinks fit to do so. thanks monsieur said monte cristo i shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband if you will do me the honor to introduce me but i can not accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen since my habitation is already <unk> what cried <unk> you are then going to a <unk> will be very dull for <unk> was i so badly lodged at rome said monte cristo smiling	52.71835708618164
i see them about twenty paces behind my lord	53.10238265991211
the noise was caused by porthos who had just knocked down his man	50.04368591308594
you need not awaken the coachman ali will <unk> in a very short time the noise of wheels was heard and the carriage stopped at the door	34.28667068481445
i invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as <unk> you are then a chemist somewhat i know lavoisier and was the intimate friend of <unk> but for such a work you must have needed <unk> you any i had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at rome but after reading them over many times i found out that with one hundred and fifty well-chosen books a man possesses if not a complete summary of all human knowledge at least all that a man need really know	122.86647033691406
ali pasha was killed as you know but before he died he recompensed the services of fernand by leaving him a considerable sum with which he returned to france when he was gazetted <unk> so that <unk> inquired the abbé	82.72187042236328
the face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask but notwithstanding this precaution which was in fact taken rather against others than against him he at once recognized his usual guide the light and intelligent mme	111.72506713867188
in truth said porthos i understand but <unk> about the middle of the rue des petits champs they were stopped by a second patrol	33.09968566894531
what do you want with a notary again repeated villefort	47.6845588684082
with that you may be satisfied he can make his way both going and <unk> in that case said athos planchet must receive seven hundred livres for going and seven hundred livres for coming back and bazin three hundred livres for going and three hundred livres for <unk> will reduce the sum to five thousand livres	77.78351593017578
i am an officer of fortune nothing else i have nothing but what my sword brings me <unk> is to say more blows than banknotes	49.194297790527344
if there was a beautiful lily or a sweet rose you had to search for it concealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban or an aunt with a bird-of-paradise	108.37582397460938
you have already tried the power of your seductions upon many men and unfortunately you have always succeeded but i give you leave to try them upon this one	96.29832458496094
then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes which he tried many times to close but in <unk> opened again as soon as shut	151.9276123046875
having aroused the enmity of the sultan he was proscribed and put to death by treachery in 1822 at the age of <unk>	83.00465393066406
during the period that the duc de <unk> passed in the <unk> he remained for twelve long <unk> his companions in their dreams of liberty said to each other as for me i shall go out of the prison at such a time and another at such and such a time the duke used to answer as for me gentlemen i shall leave only when monsieur du tremblay leaves meaning that at the death of the cardinal du tremblay would certainly lose his place at the <unk> and de <unk> regain his at court	87.20172119140625
a woman lay on the ground her head resting on the knees of a man who was seated by her as he raised his head the woman s face became visible	32.26058578491211
all the way along d <unk> had been consulting with himself whether he should place confidence in m. de <unk> or whether he should only ask him to give him <unk> <unk> for some secret affair	60.792659759521484
i think that a man must be so severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no other <unk> who told you that i loved him asked milady sharply	38.457576751708984
silence whispered the duke she has her <unk> she will ruin us returned the prince	100.32573699951172
if this ship founders like the others he is a ruined <unk> and has the unfortunate man wife or children inquired the abbé	76.2907943725586
pardon me then a fault which is perhaps great but which certainly was <unk> milady was so beautiful at this moment the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance that felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before heard	74.403076171875
i can never forgive myself monsieur said louis <unk> i command you to <unk> well sire the usurper left elba on the 26th february and landed on the 1st of <unk> and where	65.14482116699219
i would as willingly accuse myself	74.3442153930664
the four friends during the period of these two absences had as may well be supposed the eye on the watch the nose to the wind and the ear on the hark	91.385009765625
ah sir do leave a few crowns for me at the gate that i may have some things i am in need of it shall be done replied <unk>	51.80381393432617
and what a coat sir for a prince of the cavalcanti the keeper turned his back and shrugged his shoulders he did not even laugh at what would have caused anyone else to do so he had heard so many utter the same things <unk> he heard nothing else	72.81684112548828
but at all events i gave him absolution in articulo mortis	31.9585018157959
in these days the throne is too dangerous a place for me to wish him to retain it	70.23292541503906
luigi <unk> what think you of that inquired franz	105.24691772460938
he looked around he was in a court surrounded by high walls he heard the measured tread of sentinels and as they passed before the light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine	48.31938934326172
and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the helvetian who received him with great coldness	54.42306137084961
the young men sprang up and seized their muskets	56.33329391479492
i intrust to you certain papers which are at blois and in two months and a half if you do not hear of us take possession of them	61.05900573730469
athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his <unk> falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with agitation	79.61465454101562
the sentiments you air are certainly fine so fine that they are <unk> however that may be d <unk> replied athos without falling into the snare which his gascon friend had prepared for him by an appeal to his parental love however that may be you know in the bottom of your heart that it is true but i am wrong to dispute with my master	87.5691909790039
everything that savors of mystery charms them	300.1193542480469
then as it was cold he asked for his gown which was brought to him	52.10211944580078
the cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice and the king was very pale	16.616392135620117
nothing will ever go well with us hereafter oh heaven	297.7125244140625
they ask my age i tell it	115.78939056396484
<unk> when her husband had shut the street door and she found herself alone that imbecile lacked but one thing to become a <unk>	52.74576187133789
morrel i possess nearly a hundred millions and i give them to you with such a fortune you can attain every wish	98.05072784423828
mercédès was much changed within the last few days not that even in her days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in a plain and simple attire nor indeed had she fallen into that state of depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery no the change in mercédès was that her eye no longer sparkled her lips no longer smiled and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit	171.97021484375
i know not i merely suppose so as i might suppose anything else replied villefort with a look so fixed it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and madness	71.24537658691406
these thoughts gilded as they were by a last reflection of love were not the less sad	138.9497833251953
it was those very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful and the blow was so great he rushed out overcome and forgot to shut the door	98.36846923828125
beauchamp is a worthy fellow said monte cristo when the journalist was gone is he not albert yes and a sincere friend i love him devotedly	76.3746566772461
you see then said albert that instead of opposing she will encourage me. adieu then until five of the clock be punctual and we shall arrive at twelve or <unk> at <unk> yes or in the <unk> but can we travel forty-eight leagues in eight hours easily said monte cristo	70.75552368164062
at this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened and a woman appeared	34.097843170166016
still they may have concealed some precious stone some valuable diamond so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their treasures	109.06536865234375
parry too started and stopped reading	753.75634765625
the leader closed the window came out an instant after by the door and satisfied himself that the woman was in the carriage	52.2700080871582
no we shall beat them by merely temporizing	146.52890014648438
believe me madame i had entirely forgotten <unk> but it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend madame de villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me. <unk> this time at least i do not deserve your thanks	61.24329376220703
no longer could edmond look into those wide-open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed	92.63720703125
and then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor mercédès who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son	65.24893951416016
that is the hour when i am <unk> madame said the young man bowing i can refuse nothing asked of me thus	57.267478942871094
should you like to be rich and your own master <unk> said the young man was it possible there could be two answers to such a question take the <unk> which you will find waiting at the porte de <unk> as you enter nice pass through turin chambéry and <unk>	54.316898345947266
like a <unk> <unk> returned at this moment alone	60.50038528442383
you do not answer madame exclaimed the terrible interrogator	51.250022888183594
sir said he i am chief clerk of the house of thomson french of rome	19.6851749420166
then accustomed to passive obedience he jumped down from the terrace ran toward the lane and at the end of twenty paces met d <unk> who having seen all was coming to him	58.27691650390625
monsieur de mazarin is not a man of genius as i thought he is a man of no <unk> a servant of cardinal bentivoglio and he got on by intrigue	43.54766845703125
he was supplied with bread of a finer whiter quality than the usual prison fare and even regaled each sunday with a small quantity of wine	98.70841979980469
the same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated the instant afterward the flaming globe descended afresh and i was completely alone	136.6263885498047
before he had taken ten steps beyond the door i had examined the house on all sides	49.27725601196289
you certainly are a demon sent upon the earth said athos	91.19878387451172
villefort met them at the door of his study having in a few words thanked the district doctor he turned to d <unk> and said and now the <unk> is there any particular priest you wish to pray with valentine asked d <unk>	68.00016784667969
ah monsieur porthos cried the procurator s wife when she was assured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the locality could either see or hear her ah monsieur porthos you are a great conqueror as it appears i madame said porthos drawing himself up proudly how so the signs just now and the holy water	68.98141479492188
the devil exclaimed porthos there is vulcan <unk> zounds cried d <unk> then we must stop	44.75190734863281
this was simply because he lived in the hôtel	76.26609802246094
anyone but a man of <unk> thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward s extraordinary repugnance for the count s projected drive without the walls but the count was too curious to let <unk> off from this little journey	121.89717102050781
by a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven of the clock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity	52.28194808959961
i have my pride for <unk> always ready to threaten everyone who would pass without crushing them under foot	181.0914764404297
by an incredible effort of will i even raised myself up but only to sink down again immediately and to fall into the arms of my <unk> tell me who this man was cried the young officer	66.41322326660156
towards the close of the first act the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened a lady entered to whom franz had been introduced in paris where indeed he had imagined she still was	92.02111053466797
as to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first thought	114.27468872070312
why that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself <unk> why so because i am believed to be dead and have reasons for wishing nobody to know i am living so that i shall be obliged to kill you to prevent my secret from roaming over the <unk> the englishman looked at athos believing that he jested but athos did not jest the least in the world	52.67552185058594
monte cristo pressed his forehead on his burning hands as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its thoughts	39.38419723510742
i think some one is <unk> <unk> made with a low whistling sound the sign of alarm well known to the lackeys in the days of their youth resumed his place at the table and made a sign to <unk> to follow his example	83.15162658691406
he was a great <unk> will your eminence be angry if i read you a lesson i	52.23447799682617
the four friends saw all <unk> a single detail of this fearful scene escaped them	70.98701477050781
my dear said villefort in answer to his wife you know i have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family nor have i ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod	62.9646110534668
you think that it was a good deed to kill my brother who was a bonapartist because you are a royalist	38.12596893310547
morrel examined the ledgers opened the portfolio and counted the money	100.67945861816406
but why should i meddle in the matter	49.24631881713867
it however likewise appeared that the soldier on <unk> zealous catholic no <unk> off the charm for through the door he called hold your tongue madame	211.10336303710938
they were at that part of the quai des ormes where the steps lead down to the river	36.01472473144531
yes a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared tolerable	149.438232421875
oh if you know him tell me by a man of from forty to forty-five years with black hair a dark complexion and a scar on his left <unk> that is he that is he but his name ah his name	52.367881774902344
meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully locked	58.934993743896484
bring her in said the president	94.61518859863281
if i were obliged to fight against you i think i should allow myself to be pierced through and through for i never loved any one but you in the wide world and honest porthos burst into tears as he embraced athos	92.45878601074219
he thought how one day in a less dangerous situation than the one in which he was now placed he had already endeavored to sacrifice her to his honor	58.97730255126953
however sire if i might advise your majesty will interrogate the person of whom i spoke to you and i will urge your majesty to do him this <unk> most willingly duke under your auspices i will receive any person you please but you must not expect me to be too confiding	96.47637939453125

well bazin said d <unk> since you do not know where your master lives let us speak of it no more let us part good friends	54.68264389038086
he judged that the match would be so much the less equal if athos and his companions were really plotting and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at command all his anger faded away into a smile	99.68701934814453
dantès was on the way he desired to follow and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom	65.57334899902344
the ship drew on and had safely passed the strait which some volcanic shock has made between the <unk> and jaros islands had doubled <unk> and approached the harbor under topsails jib and spanker but so slowly and sedately that the idlers with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board	121.06581115722656

after a few minutes of silent embarrassment athos spoke	84.55339050292969
morrel attributed <unk> s embarrassment to the elegance of his attire it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account he was no doubt engaged on board some other vessel and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having if we may so express ourselves worn mourning for the <unk> longer	136.59902954101562

well said he to the young girl are you willing my dear kitty that i should give you a proof of that love which you doubt what love asked the young girl	37.0974235534668
<unk> madame <unk> had risen and stood before the procureur whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp	52.87314224243164
she has never been so kind before	65.82403564453125
i am sure my dear albert whatever may be your career you will soon render that name illustrious	86.30604553222656
the king who was entirely surrounded walked alone in a great empty space	105.65294647216797
de villefort he said will you conduct the baroness <unk> villefort complied and they passed on to the dining-room	79.68962860107422
d <unk> had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner to whom this man had confided some important missive	43.86962127685547
anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy	101.6944808959961
thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding her hints she persisted in watching all night	74.18489074707031
listen i am already upon the scent resumed d <unk>	81.88328552246094
franz questioned albert as to his intentions but albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre and instead of making any answer he inquired if signor <unk> could procure him a tailor	82.9754867553711
i have sent for three of my friends but who knows whether they were at home yes yes	35.90731430053711
i dressed myself as quickly as possible my slow and stiff motions all attested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely dissipated	72.16522979736328
ah said the count you have then not forgotten that i saved your life that is strange for it is a week <unk> <unk> no excellency and never shall i forget it returned peppino with an accent of profound gratitude	55.670753479003906
oh sir reply i entreat <unk> not the comte de la fere a noble whom i remember handsome and brave a musketeer under louis <unk> who must be now about forty-seven or forty-eight years of age yes sir you are right in every particular and who served under an assumed name under the name of athos	72.26515197753906
have you sir asked he a letter accrediting you to me there it is my lord said the young man	31.198776245117188
is not it reasonable yes dear friend athos replied but you said a word the other day that was more than <unk> was noble and generous	96.39857482910156
who has told me this fine story monsieur	68.05836486816406
mademoiselle said franz turning towards valentine unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan at two years of <unk> valentine remained dumb and motionless	75.02812194824219
had his majesty asked he any intention of holding this hunting party yesterday no your excellency replied the valet de chambre the master of the hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a stag	153.2032470703125
you blackguard cried athos going toward him i will cut your ears off at the same instant four men armed to the teeth entered by side doors and rushed upon athos	100.84916687011719
do that cried she and you will have saved my life you will have saved my honor do not exaggerate the service i have the happiness to render your majesty	45.130104064941406
he took <unk> one side while the young girl seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made a veil of her picturesque head-dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits	41.36018371582031
captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is <unk> electricity lightning from lightning <unk> no replied dantès	74.71622467041016
it seemed to her that they wanted to revenge the past and not to anticipate the future	44.781654357910156
d <unk> unfolded it with one hand whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal to read december 3 1627 it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done	58.11183547973633
alas said felton i can do but one thing which is to pity you if you prove to me you are a victim	43.15406799316406
i will allow you to make me hateful but i will prevent your rendering me ridiculous and above all i forbid you to ruin me. the baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of villefort had been pronounced but then she became pale and rising as if touched by a spring she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition she then took two or three steps towards her husband as though to tear the secret from him of which he was ignorant or which he withheld from some odious calculation <unk> as all his calculations were	76.02522277832031
madame said albert allow me to present to you m. maximilian morrel captain of spahis one of our best and above all of our bravest <unk> i have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil at the house of the count of monte cristo replied madame de villefort turning away with marked coldness of manner	43.67739486694336
they passed in silence through the little village of festubert where the wounded servant was and then skirted the wood of richebourg	61.4484977722168
it would have signified little had the room been empty but unfortunately it was occupied	143.42356872558594
it was nothing but a plan of attack against the cardinal	37.47825622558594
from valentine the young man looked towards <unk>	64.41120147705078
but what is going on in the city yonder said athos	29.111141204833984
i do not know her but a sort of intuition tells me she is a lost creature and that there is something fatal about <unk> you are right said d <unk> i will have done with her	35.4140510559082
i see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward <unk> i think replied porthos it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre again it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way and a failure would be ruinous	70.25141143798828
although d <unk> was not of a very sentimental character the mercer s pretty wife had made a real impression upon his heart	44.45951461791992
yes the rolling of a <unk> it is the one my brother sends for <unk> oh my god come come	75.78023529052734
<unk> the president called for the indictment revised as we know by the clever and implacable pen of villefort	120.35604858398438
when i see her majesty embarrassed i shall conduct her to rueil make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a <unk> enough sir muttered the cardinal you have said enough where is the treaty here it is replied aramis	107.09650421142578
milady had likewise the best of <unk> beauty her noble appearance and the liberality with which she distributed her <unk>	96.49152374267578
let us see with your thousand crowns from the abbey and the twelve thousand francs you make by selling sermons are you rich	61.46660614013672
i faith aramis believe me there is little left to regret	167.0245361328125
<unk> <unk> of the cardinal monsieur de <unk> i am vexed with you this was the chance at which m. de <unk> waited for the king	38.33888244628906
meanwhile what are you going to do i yes <unk> it is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me. since you interest yourself in my affairs i think it is now my turn to ask you some <unk> ah true	53.04977035522461
there was a study for emmanuel who never studied and a <unk> for julie who never played	199.3777618408203
no positively i will not go	117.92728424072266
5 scott of course the son of an ill-fated sire and the father of a yet more unfortunate family bore in his looks that cast of inauspicious melancholy by which the <unk> of that time pretended to distinguish those who were predestined to a violent and unhappy <unk> <unk> abbot ch	82.29997253417969
the next morning when kitty presented herself at d <unk> s she was no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days but on the contrary sad as death	52.422645568847656
it is probable you are ignorant of this little fact said athos	29.10504150390625
did you not once refuse to undertake a journey to brussels for the queen ah	67.35519409179688
that has cured me of beautiful poetical and loving women said athos after a considerable pause raising his head and forgetting to continue the fiction of the count	87.22525787353516
what is he waiting for asked another	109.3547592163086
as he came near the hotel franz saw a man in the middle of the street	22.96977424621582
there are a few things that you can do with most project <unk> electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement	20.288837432861328
a few shots were fired and one musketeer was wounded	59.21917724609375
all three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the alert	44.46928787231445
do you think that i sorrow for madame <unk>	45.32651138305664
as to the astute aramis he did not entertain much dread of him and supposing he should be able to get so far he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least by hitting him in the face as cæsar recommended his soldiers do to those of pompey to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud	83.7470703125
he had himself a daughter about her age but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her mother having been consumptive	88.77880096435547
it seemed to him that if porthos and aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it but that athos on the contrary would despise him	46.90657424926758
ah monsieur said he after having vainly searched on the <unk> and the shelves i have not got any <unk> take one of the <unk> <unk> said the count and show me the <unk> the steward obeyed in silence but it was easy to see from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled how much it cost him to obey	47.45596694946289
i answered in <unk> then said he write to <unk> and who thus advised you no other than your friend monte <unk> the count of monte cristo told you to write to yanina yes and i wrote and will show you my correspondence if you <unk> albert and beauchamp looked at each other	53.07929992675781

these gentlemen wage war on private account and in buying them up by granting them what they wished monsieur le cardinal has made a good bargain	68.06245422363281
athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or stunned	67.8552474975586
but you have been traveling these four days as you told me yourself	56.983341217041016
captivity the first day chapter liii	65.18898010253906
the count received him with his habitual smile	31.03361701965332
all at once she paused a livid flash darted from her eyes she ran to the table emptied into mme	76.05970764160156
the king was closeted with the cardinal and m. de <unk> was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that moment	24.48732566833496
i will be an abbé if it suits me	55.861976623535156
this assurance determined the two friends to accept it	112.077880859375
felton began to descend the ladder slowly step by step	124.76294708251953
felton quite bewildered almost mad stood speechless	423.1423034667969
you have no longer a weapon and besides i am on my guard	39.85355758666992
although the coadjutor had preached that same morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the fronde and mazarin in requesting the archbishop of paris to make his nephew preach had evidently had the intention of administering to monsieur de retz one of those italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving	88.28491973876953
porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just demolished	87.82084655761719
alas alas said he to himself misfortune is over my head my wife must have committed some frightful crime	99.95523834228516
all have forgiven me some have even loved me but i think that god has not pardoned me for the memory of that execution pursues me constantly and every night i see that woman s ghost rising before me. a woman	104.96369171142578
i never knew till now the delight of speed said <unk> and the last cloud disappeared from his brow but where the devil do you get such horses	125.28363037109375
it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind	64.6747055053711
the baron has just related a frightful story to me. milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim and shook her head	85.48348999023438
oh good lord said kitty in a low voice what is the matter with you	22.318294525146484
yes said <unk> taking it from beyond his reach and as what i say and do is merely in jest and i amongst the first and foremost should be sorry if anything happened to <unk> worthy <unk> here and taking the letter he squeezed it up in his hands and threw it into a corner of the arbor	85.855224609375
franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle	59.626861572265625
after casting a rapid glance around him in order to assure himself that he was unobserved he entered by the small gate and carefully closing and securing it after him proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier	52.376670837402344
come my dear bazin tell me where he <unk> did not you hear me tell you monsieur d <unk> that i do not know where he is yes certainly but to that i answer that it is <unk> it is nevertheless the truth <unk> pure truth the truth of the good <unk> d <unk> saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of aramis but whose lies were bold and decided	61.397239685058594
they had not seen him for two days	25.01302146911621
come here <unk> bazin who was crossing the <unk> majestically in his clerical dress turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing them	112.0152587890625
four years ago <unk> was at <unk> count is the old sailor you saw in the garden and who from quartermaster has become <unk> when he was at trieste saw on the quay an englishman who was on the point of embarking on board a yacht and he recognized him as the person who called on my father the fifth of june 1829 and who wrote me this letter on the fifth of september	62.30257797241211
aramis blushing in spite of himself took the letter which was in a large coarse hand and not particular for its orthography	63.295894622802734
ah my lord he said have you come to drive away those rascal spaniards and those lorraine robbers yes said the prince if you will serve me as <unk> willingly my lord	64.5304183959961

master <unk> is being <unk> it was <unk> s voice and dame nanette feeling herself supported recommenced with all her strength to sound her shrilly squawk	88.16876983642578
in about ten minutes d <unk> appeared at the door followed by the inseparable porthos	28.238788604736328
a convulsive movement again brought him to the surface	67.18083190917969
change these lackeys said he she has spoken to them	139.2801971435547
on the contrary there is not an hour we have passed together that is not present to my <unk> yes yes said porthos trying to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whilst he had been alone	46.79473114013672
the old man appeared to be listening attentively and as affectionately as his infirmities would allow to the abbé busoni who looked cold and calm as usual	55.939064025878906
they will return said d <unk>	21.68851089477539
it does not appear to be very clean in the <unk> d <unk> glanced down at his boots all covered with mud but that same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer and it might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap	53.66459655761719
to no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous <unk> more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a king s ransom in his waistcoat pocket	88.79856872558594
no the sacrifice returned <unk> ask debray if he would sacrifice his english steed for a stranger not for a stranger said debray but for a friend i might <unk> i divined that you would become mine count replied morrel besides as i had the honor to tell you heroism or not sacrifice or not that day i owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other days granted to <unk> the history to which m. morrel alludes continued <unk> is an admirable one which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him today let us fill our stomachs and not our memories	120.14595031738281

perhaps you liked what m. <unk> said another sign in the negative	107.18653106689453
there said monte cristo placing his arms around the count and leaning with him over the front of the box just as haydée whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale features close to <unk> s face	69.9439697265625
what do you wish gentlemen who are you said the same voice in the same commanding tone	29.392786026000977
ah you have a noble heart said the count so much the <unk> this exclamation which corresponded to the count s own thought rather than to what albert was saying surprised everybody and especially morrel who looked at monte cristo with wonder	63.93225860595703
charles was perceived through the door lying dressed upon his bed at the head of which parry was seated reading in a low voice a chapter from the bible	66.65596008300781
before an hour has passed you will be discovered arrested obliged to kill me which would be a crime unworthy of loyal gentlemen like <unk> he is right thought athos	94.11998748779297
no said she i do not remember it just at this moment but if it should occur to me presently i will tell <unk> albert was on the point of pronouncing his father s name when monte cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach the young man recollected his promise and was silent	39.098934173583984
chapter <unk> how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches not on the same night as he had stated but the next morning the count of monte cristo went out by the barrière d enfer taking the road to orléans	37.76626968383789
one last favor my lord said he to the baron	67.29798126220703

it was like the eve of a battle the heart beat the eyes laughed and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose was after all a good thing	108.00175476074219
and am i not a hundred times better thus cried eugénie smoothing the scattered curls of her hair which had now quite a masculine appearance and do you not think me handsomer so oh you are <unk> beautiful cried louise	78.79100799560547
with a man like you i fear <unk> athos bowed	69.37855529785156
what would my good father say who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal if he knew i was in the society of such pagans we have no need therefore to say that d <unk> dared not join in the conversation only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard-of things which were taking place	91.40670776367188
you have to do with that woman	34.165653228759766
i stabbed to the heart the headsman of bethune without mercy or pity and he was the least guilty of you <unk> with these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved then upon the lowest landing place he passed tony leaning over the balustrade waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his room	95.6194839477539
it is you <unk> she said	28.030166625976562

the library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall and contained upwards of two thousand volumes one division was entirely devoted to novels and even the volume which had been published but the day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and gold binding	62.28805160522461
villefort smiled within himself for he felt his increased importance	234.83224487304688

we therefore represent six fighting men if we should meet a little troop of enemies equal or even superior in number to our own shall we charge them raoul certainly sir replied the viscount	185.78176879882812
he entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask	26.074689865112305
the occupant of the box in which the greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed for he left his seat to stand up in front so that his countenance being fully revealed franz had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of monte cristo and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him	87.56105041503906
explain to me why going out of this chamber is not <unk> because having neither arms nor password we should not take fifty steps in the court without knocking against a <unk> very well said porthos we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his <unk> yes but before we can kill <unk> he will be hard to kill that <unk> will shriek out and the whole picket will come and we shall be taken like foxes we who are lions and thrown into some dungeon where we shall not even have the consolation of seeing this frightful gray sky of rueil which no more resembles the sky of tarbes than the moon is like the sun	87.72516632080078

besides sir said villefort addressing himself to his future son-in-law excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes this unexpected will need not personally wound you m. <unk> s weakness of mind sufficiently explains it	123.87370300292969
when the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two <unk> it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to pass	52.23761749267578
besides the physician might declare the ailment feigned and milady after having lost the first trick was not willing to lose the second	72.4139633178711

will that satisfy you must this last formality take place in your presence sir inquired a turnkey	122.76170349121094
must you know all absolutely and rather from your lips than another s. muster up all your courage then for never have you required it <unk> albert passed his hand over his forehead as if to try his strength as a man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends his sword	78.286376953125
loose <unk> imposing the king s musketeers or rather m. de <unk> s spread themselves about in the cabarets in the public walks and the public sports shouting twisting their mustaches clanking their swords and taking great pleasure in annoying the guards of the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them then drawing in the open streets as if it were the best of all possible sports sometimes killed but sure in that case to be both wept and avenged often killing others but then certain of not rotting in prison m. de <unk> being there to claim them	124.45142364501953
yes he murmured yes be <unk> his head dropped upon his chest and in this position he paced his study then he threw himself dressed as he was upon a sofa less to sleep than to rest his limbs cramped with cold and study	125.09971618652344
i am going down there to pronounce the sentence of death against a murderer	60.147926330566406
now said aramis we know how the matter stands	57.818546295166016
it was the island of <unk>	17.20701789855957
oh my god i have suffered enough surely	81.78666687011719
just as he was passing the count s box the door opened and monte cristo came forth	31.213911056518555
now say if i conceal anything from you no and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion and your princely father is he rich very rich yes he is that he does not himself know the amount of his <unk> is it possible it is evident enough to me who am always at his house	78.46025848388672
do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted asked the abbé	48.20925521850586
now this was a sunday and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him	46.56782913208008
these four frenchmen have escaped from newcastle and no doubt want to carry off the king	80.46702575683594
he is a perfect nobleman very polite modest and agreeable such as may be found constantly in italy descendants of very ancient families	114.84382629394531
but i am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly <unk> how have i deviated from those principles monsieur asked monte cristo who could not help looking at morrel with so much intensity that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance	59.57172775268555
then he thought it was time to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple lips of faria and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat	61.224693298339844
he cast a rapid glance around the room and perceived that one of his men was missing	22.402650833129883
tell us news of yourself as often as you can that is to say as often as you can with safety	81.22607421875
as i am of the church and the affair might injure me if i should share it with any other than a sure friend like you i write to beg that you will serve me as second	66.88092803955078
aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutor s misfortune and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct when athos stopped him	94.31685638427734
aramis saluted then turning toward athos i do not care to camp on the place royale with all these people he said	87.20188903808594
oh i have been base cowardly i tell you i have abjured my affections and like all renegades i am of evil omen to those who surround me no mercédès said monte cristo no you judge yourself with too much severity	55.73316955566406
planchet who was still a little concerned for his safety after his recent escapade declared that he would follow d <unk> even to the end of the world either by the road to the right or by that to the left only he begged his former master to set out in the evening for greater security to himself	60.20583724975586
at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down	32.902854919433594
and now at last said the queen now that we are alone repeat your counsel monsieur le <unk> it is this madame that you should appear to have reflected and publicly acknowledge an error which constitutes the extra strength of a strong government release <unk> from prison and give him back to the <unk> oh cried anne to humble myself thus	88.1885757446289
their vows were sacred and irrevocable	109.16808319091797
ah dear constance i have found you then i see you at last and milady stretched out her arms to mme	43.6234130859375
you are among friends said athos in english so cheer up and tell us if you have the strength to do so what has happened the king muttered the wounded man the king is a <unk> you have seen him asked aramis in the same language	35.17067337036133
in the court he found <unk> who with a rouleau of a hundred francs in either hand seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them	51.852783203125
and do you comprehend grimaud said aramis	35.48119354248047
and on this assurance the four friends who had finished their modest repast separated with the promise of meeting again that evening	72.7721939086914
he turned around and seized his new antagonist by the wrist when he started back exclaiming raoul raoul cried athos	78.88758850097656
<unk> could not close his eyes not because his dungeon was so very disagreeable but because his uneasiness was so great	102.20658111572266
but that same night he found himself the possessor of a fine house situated on the boulevard de la madeleine and an income of 50,000 livres	42.93101119995117
as he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a cry	29.58295249938965
i broke my word it is true but what signifies that	75.89167785644531
ah my lord it is a great happiness that the queen who always wished you well had a fancy to send you here where there is a promenade and a tennis court good air and a good <unk> in short answered the duke if i comprehend you aright la <unk> i am ungrateful for having ever thought of leaving this place oh	78.77448272705078
a great age you mean monsieur porthos	137.87542724609375
this is the second time that monsieur d <unk> has been in england	22.82162857055664
the iron box was <unk> one had touched <unk> a beautiful <unk> my father had planted the day i was born which overshadowed the spot	117.7392807006836
my friend said he here is a proof of <unk> <unk> albert opened the paper it was an attestation of four notable inhabitants of yanina proving that colonel fernand mondego in the service of ali <unk> had surrendered the castle for two million crowns	34.44790267944336
it is quite wonderful said albert	25.21175765991211
will that do <unk> replied m. de <unk>	57.09760665893555
the day was passed at saint peter s alone	48.95877456665039
help me <unk> me your assistance <unk> looked at the dictionary	60.17733383178711
as he approached it <unk> s gaze followed him and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart	46.12915802001953
i said a million replied <unk> with the confidence of ignorance	86.03768157958984
the devil take the constitutional government and since we had our choice as they say at least how could we choose that i understand you must lay in a stock of <unk> do not run down m. <unk> speeches said debray he votes for you for he belongs to the <unk> <unk> that is exactly the worst of all	70.95023345947266
<unk> eh <unk> said the individual whose description we have twice given entering the door what a great deal of ceremony	134.46388244628906
it is not civil war that <unk> us	34.270267486572266
our clothes have a cut which would proclaim the frenchman at first sight	166.78648376464844
ah you fellows are good managers	87.3846206665039
the gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other guard at his <unk> but his mother	105.7270278930664
sire said athos we foresaw this and if lord winter s men but do their duty we are saved instead of <unk> at this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses winter s voice crying out sword in hand at these words every sword was drawn and glittered in the air like lightning	102.47087097167969
come forget him for a moment and instead of pursuing him let him <unk> you are too late madame the orders are <unk> well should he be <unk> they think they will arrest him i hope so. if they should arrest him i know that sometimes prisons afford means of escape will you leave him in prison the procureur shook his head	74.96772003173828
at this moment a horse without a rider covered with foam his nostrils extended and eyes all fire galloped up and recognizing his master stopped and <unk> with pleasure it was arthur	91.16703796386719
in that case said he i should lose her and by my own <unk> he dwelt on this idea for a moment then it appeared reality	62.61016082763672
let us call one of these lackeys with a <unk> in the left <unk> exactly so cried aramis	43.25157165527344
the cardinal made an approving gesture and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in coming	42.815303802490234
now as a <unk> was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily imagined	37.43051528930664
six days had already passed out of the ten he had asked from mordaunt he was therefore occupied in revising his reply to cromwell when some one knocked gently at the door of communication with the queen s apartments	75.00394439697266
that is unpardonable in a man of your age and who besides has such a pretty wife as <unk> oh lord	58.09138870239258
do you come from the end of the world said monte cristo you a journalist the husband of renown	28.981895446777344
i sometimes wonder replied athos smiling at that <unk> which recalled the good old days that we could form an association of men who would be after twenty years of separation still so closely bound together	113.17326354980469
monsieur d <unk> is a young man scarcely nineteen or twenty and this gentleman must be thirty at least	40.23046112060547
if on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight of the clock in the evening you are not here no <unk> if it be but five minutes past <unk> then monsieur said planchet you must buy me a <unk> take this said athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good lad	38.825218200683594
<unk> uttered a kind of hoarse rattling sound the old man s eyes sparkled and the good doctor understood that he wished to behold his child	38.63324737548828
this is all i know but i know not count how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of rome who ordinarily have so little respect for anything	101.6531753540039
the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt	89.85755920410156
gentlemen said he you have heard the comte de <unk> s defence	20.791385650634766
they search her she resists they use <unk> scoundrels in spite of his prudence d <unk> restrained himself with great difficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on below	93.86384582519531
athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd	70.57454681396484
do you think anything else was to be expected of them asked comminges who putting together what mazarin had said of his prisoners and what the comte de la fere had said began to feel a degree of uneasiness	71.40662384033203
when he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the count had gone out about half an hour previously	28.117782592773438
two inches an hour does not seem much but in twelve hours that makes two feet and three we had before that makes five	194.73828125
she had succeeded d <unk> was then in her power	37.47603988647461
is this carriage for me said dantès	47.33024978637695
i have measures to <unk> she will escape us replied the young man she will escape us and it will be your fault <unk> i will be accountable for her said athos	39.87743377685547
julie trembled at this request which seemed to her of bad omen	75.4741439819336
the two ladies entered the drawing-room with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication	54.61265182495117
you gave your direction to no one but your <unk> yet i have your address and in proof i am here the very instant you are going to sit at table	78.81359100341797
at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and <unk> saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome	47.08789825439453
albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point	99.83081817626953
in this case milady would cross the garden and gain the village on foot	93.12096405029297
i thought for a long time that he was dumb he answers only by signs	89.3659439086914
the queen will never banish me and even were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield with me if i fly she will fly and then we shall see how the rebels will get on without either king or queen	90.82022857666016
in the name of the queen i forbid you to throw yourself into any peril which is foreign to that of your <unk> and do you command nothing in your own name in my name said mme	42.71970748901367
i wish them to be promulgated <unk> but my lord if the lord chancellor interrogates me upon the motives which may have led your grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure what shall i reply that such is my pleasure and that i answer for my will to no <unk> will that be the answer replied the secretary smiling which he must transmit to his majesty if by chance his majesty should have the curiosity to know why no vessel is to leave any of the ports of great britain you are right mr. jackson replied buckingham	86.26576232910156
mazarin went to the right hand and aramis could see the prisoner disappear at the turning of the avenue	39.92781448364258
could you allow me a few words in <unk> what did i tell you said the governor	26.643470764160156
can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last said athos	50.71830749511719
d <unk> would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk for he knew well that to mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform	91.11901092529297
i was thinking my dear old friend that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church and now that you are an abbé you are perpetually longing to be once more a <unk> it is true man as you know said aramis is a strange animal made up of contradictions	55.76765060424805
three months passed and still she <unk> news of edmond no news of fernand no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair	124.55442810058594
what shall we do <unk> why the same we had intended doing three days <unk> <unk> what <unk> you are not now going to be married you intend <unk> listen louise	97.3976058959961
the apartment of m. <unk> then became a mousetrap and whoever appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinal s people	76.48365783691406
i have said what i have said. and as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation replied d <unk> in a low voice i beg you to follow me. and when asked the guardsman with the same jeering air	47.11970138549805
ah said <unk> there goes a happy man and it so happened albert was not mistaken in his opinion	61.12702941894531
it is you who have told me that you had a secret to confide in me	27.187292098999023
during the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy with his companions porthos and aramis they could remember having often seen him smile but had never heard him laugh	70.02519226074219
you know or you do not know that that is what we ask of <unk> oh	35.195526123046875
ten parts of a hundred <unk> each in ten throws without revenge in thirteen throws i had lost <unk> thirteen throws	144.48248291015625
the guide held the door open	62.83863830566406
edmond found some solace in these ideas	193.2406005859375
well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man tonight	63.22762680053711
i can not resist doing so he must <unk> zounds replied d <unk> why do not you give yourself up directly feet and hands bound to that wretch	130.38722229003906
the latter took in the whole scene at a glance	50.191925048828125
how happy i am at this word <unk> athos who had seated himself quietly started up	93.51190948486328
the footman opened the door and announced monsieur le comte de la fere	19.963865280151367
the keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took andrea by the hands and began examining his person attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the lions den to something more substantial than mere fascination	65.37114715576172
you see said the king that it is useless for you to resist	33.20781326293945
at length after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken a carriage appeared coming at a quick pace on the road of sèvres	41.79153060913086
i have engaged the three lower windows at the café <unk> should i have obtained the requisite pardon for peppino the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks and the centre with white having a large cross in red marked on <unk> and whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution send one of your men disguised as a penitent friar and i will give it to him	98.24382781982422
he addressed himself then to porthos to gain information respecting athos and aramis and to aramis in order to learn something of porthos	63.40306854248047
and you go into that house cried he briskly	99.9779281616211
just so. then you are called monsieur grimaud the traveler made a sign of assent	54.97910690307617
once past the frontier andrea proposed making money of his diamonds and by uniting the proceeds to ten <unk> he always carried about with him in case of accident he would then find himself possessor of about 50,000 livres which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition after all	175.85011291503906
<unk> go on sir said he	39.41520309448242
he filled two glasses and by a sign invited d <unk> to drink	59.393798828125
ah traitor muttered d <unk> leaning toward aramis and whispering in his ear you have made us swear on the crucifix of a <unk> chapter xxix	50.21389389038086
well this is just what amuses me said monte cristo	40.92239761352539
tell him that our conversation at the inn of the red dovecot was overheard by these four men tell him that after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by violence the safe-conduct which he had given me tell him they warned lord de winter of my journey to england that this time they nearly foiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs tell him that among these four men two only are to be <unk> <unk> and athos tell him that the third aramis is the lover of madame de <unk> may be left alone we know his secret and it may be useful as to the fourth porthos he is a fool a simpleton a blustering booby not worth troubling himself <unk> but these four men must be now at the siege of la rochelle i thought so too but a letter which madame <unk> has received from madame the constable and which she has had the imprudence to show me leads me to believe that these four men on the contrary are on the road hither to take her <unk> the devil	90.10189819335938
the travelers then comprehended that there must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence and ceased to address themselves to him	116.13005828857422
planchet called his master s attention to a gentleman who had just arrived with his lackey and only preceded them by about fifty paces	64.39869689941406
i opened the door of the <unk> myself and i saw you enter at the end of the <unk> because i was shown up the private <unk> how so i know not it must have been a <unk> mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make d <unk> reveal anything he was desirous of hiding so he gave up for the time the discovery of the mystery the gascon was concealing	54.161380767822266
the host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth	97.31929016113281
well to-morrow i am on <unk> in stuart s room yes come and pass the night with me. impossible impossible	126.28009796142578
the count filled one glass but in the other he only poured a few drops of the <unk> liquid	52.967647552490234
d <unk> then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying mazarin s bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the minister s finger that night	67.65874481201172
you do not think of holding out against a whole regiment do you said porthos	44.286659240722656
and what guarantee will you give me asked she if i consent to confide this message to you my love for you	61.359107971191406
he clung to one <unk> of his happiness destroyed without apparent because by an unheard-of fatality he considered and reconsidered this idea devoured it so to speak as the implacable ugolino devours the skull of archbishop roger in the inferno of dante	136.60130310058594
fortunately he fancied that dantès was delirious and placing the food on the rickety table he withdrew	65.30805206298828
the sport was bad franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges and like every unsuccessful sportsman he returned to the boat very much out of temper	177.22982788085938
la <unk> said the king let someone go instantly and find monsieur de la <unk> i wish to speak with him this <unk> your majesty gives me your word that you will not see anyone between monsieur de la <unk> and myself nobody by the faith of a <unk> tomorrow then sire tomorrow <unk> at what of the clock please your majesty at any hour you <unk> but in coming too early i should be afraid of awakening your <unk> awaken me	62.68992614746094
the four young men standing and motionless followed him with their eyes without speaking a single word until he had disappeared	37.80482482910156
so in twelve times you thrice missed the <unk> which you sir struck twelve times answered raoul smiling	127.61210632324219
he had therefore set off at a furious rate from the rue <unk> and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the faubourg saint-honoré	29.342342376708984
besides the manner in which beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart	98.3013687133789
take the stairs on your right go up the first flight and knock at number one	225.5946502685547
luigi asked permission of his protector the steward that she and he might be present amongst the servants of the house	95.51777648925781
she was within three steps of the bottom she already heard morrel s voice when suddenly a cloud passed over her eyes her stiffened foot missed the step her hands had no power to hold the baluster and falling against the wall she lost her balance wholly and toppled to the floor	75.81080627441406
i thought as much said d <unk> wasting his strength in useless efforts	51.53892135620117
as to love the only woman he could have loved was mme	128.8269500732422
you <unk> more <unk> yes sir i will give my attention to the <unk> i do not say that i await with pleasure his decision but i do await it	48.341163635253906
he was compelled then after having swallowed the contents of his bottle to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep whether well or ill. d <unk> be it remembered was only twenty years old and at that age sleep has its <unk> rights which it imperiously insists upon even with the saddest hearts	84.20832824707031
this doublet and hose though new were creased like traveling clothes for a long time packed in a portmanteau	194.8529052734375
you see they are going to send a whole regiment against us said athos	31.488468170166016
from day to day he lived on alone and more and more solitary	175.7802734375
the chancellor <unk> who twenty years previously had persecuted her so ruthlessly stood before her relating how his carriage had been smashed how he had been pursued and had rushed into the hotel d <unk> that the hotel was immediately invaded pillaged and devastated happily he had time to reach a closet hidden behind tapestry in which he was secreted by an old woman together with his brother the bishop of meaux	76.64002227783203
do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat aramis rushed after the fugitive hat	62.040096282958984
la <unk> took his hand and laughed aloud	33.42218780517578
thus illumined aramis read the following epistle my dear d <unk> <unk> learned from d <unk> who has embraced me on the part of the comte de la fere and yourself that you are setting out on a journey which may perhaps last two or three months as i know that you do not like to ask money of your friends i offer you some of my own accord	47.01642608642578
d <unk> approached her with his usual gallantry	25.947925567626953
you see m. morrel said he we were somewhere between cape blanc and cape <unk> sailing with a fair breeze south-south-west after a week s calm when captain <unk> comes up to <unk> was at the helm i should tell <unk> says <unk> what do you think of those clouds coming up over there i was just then looking at them myself	78.64964294433594
have you lost it asked <unk>	30.216796875
well said the queen blinded by her obstinacy	37.69572067260742
why in the first place i gave you <unk> you think so <unk> ah that is true	26.64325523376465
no more edicts no more of the cardinal s guards no more de <unk> nor other bloodhounds	89.30451965332031
it is war said the prince	27.362327575683594

you thought yourselves alone and talked about that tragical death and the fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of <unk> villefort and d <unk> exchanged looks	103.2053451538086
i also was married at the death-bed of my mother and certainly i have not been less happy on that <unk> still that idea of death madame said villefort	63.5515022277832
after he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battle-field the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself	49.0814208984375
patrick soon caught the sound of his master s voice calling his falcon	59.689212799072266
in that case we are as well off as we <unk> and yet said porthos i would like to know what grimaud is <unk> silence porthos said aramis	42.18968963623047
the count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where <unk> would come over	77.6119384765625
come in said monte cristo with a voice that betrayed not the least emotion and immediately beauchamp appeared	81.15151977539062

grimaud continued to climb like a cat and succeeded at last in catching hold of a hook which served to keep one of the shutters back when opened	102.23509216308594
the explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do	70.64033508300781
the betrothed had retired as we said with haughty air disdainful lip and the demeanor of an outraged queen followed by her companion who was paler and more disturbed than herself	110.6607894897461
he then turned to the left down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends but as he opened the door he paused as if in thought	44.87527847290039
i have drawn nine hundred thousand francs you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs	54.266014099121094

i should be glad to know what connection there can possibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the state oh mother murmured renée	58.143489837646484
his devotion and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes produced the effect they always produce on noble <unk> had always had a sincere regard for fernand and this was now strengthened by gratitude	123.15904998779297

but as regards your wish to visit our fine city my dear count i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you <unk> then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long <unk> franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of monte cristo and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely hoping to read something of his purpose in his face but his countenance was inscrutable especially when as in the present case it was veiled in a <unk> smile	68.62096405029297
her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother	102.05516815185547
if he demands my daughter let him fix the <unk> his conditions in short let us either understand each other or quarrel	120.77774810791016
the audience m. de <unk> was at the moment in rather <unk> nevertheless he saluted the young man politely who bowed to the very ground and he smiled on receiving d <unk> s response the <unk> accent of which recalled to him at the same time his youth and his <unk> double remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages but stepping toward the antechamber and making a sign to d <unk> with his hand as if to ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him he called three times with a louder voice at each time so that he ran through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry accent	65.8232192993164
the hôtel then is far away at the other end of the <unk> very well said milady and she resolutely entered the carriage	52.07282257080078

you owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that i should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your <unk> it is from no personal ill-feeling towards the viscount that is all i can say sir replied <unk> who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that <unk> was a little softened and calmed down	59.037601470947266

the next minute franz heard himself called by albert who made the lofty building <unk> with the sound of his friend s name	73.94982147216797

the host called the <unk> and ordered him to saddle <unk> <unk> then he awoke his son a child of seven years whom he ordered to ride before the gentleman and bring back the horse	76.90069580078125

but at the same moment his two auditors accompanied by the host fell upon d <unk> with sticks shovels and tongs	37.00255584716797
the old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk trimmed with steel buttons beautifully cut and polished	35.72564697265625

eugénie bowed coldly to the count and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured monte cristo that mademoiselle <unk> preferred to his society and to that of m. cavalcanti the company of mademoiselle louise d <unk> her singing teacher	74.699951171875
although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century	68.9808578491211
d <unk> obeyed like a child without the least resistance or objection which proved that he was really in love	51.674991607666016

whole hours sometimes passed while faria was giving instructions to dantès <unk> which were to serve him when he was at liberty	100.9388427734375

soubrette and mistress meantime as we have said despite the cries of his conscience and the wise counsels of athos d <unk> became hourly more in love with milady	115.2889175415039

hardly had they given the bridles of their horses to their lackeys and rid themselves of their cloaks when a man approached them and after looking at them for an instant by the doubtful light of the lantern hung in the centre of the courtyard he uttered an exclamation of joy and ran to embrace them	40.39097213745117
then they looked at one another	43.107818603515625
repair your crimes toward her let her go free and i will exact nothing else from <unk> you will exact said buckingham looking at felton with astonishment and dwelling upon each syllable of the three words as he pronounced them	142.48614501953125
but we must say at the present moment d <unk> was ruled by a feeling much more noble and disinterested	48.455020904541016
why should you expose your game to your adversary	51.95768737792969
m. <unk> was introduced afresh and upon a sign from the cardinal the officer retired	42.801124572753906

ah cried valentine suddenly i understand	67.68174743652344
the boat indeed seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence so promptly did it obey the slightest touch and dantès required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of shipbuilding	95.12810516357422
the first object that met the eyes of d <unk> on entering the room was <unk> stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible convulsions	38.256649017333984
he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his master s wishes and had already gone to fetch one	59.13731384277344
he let off his fire at but four paces	207.93280029296875
there said <unk> and now although you have wronged us of perhaps 10,000 francs will you have your supper with us	45.78650665283203
the man who was with <unk> was evidently a stranger to the south of france he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the beaucaire fair and who during the month the fair lasts and during which there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all parts of europe often have dealings to the amount of 100,000 to 150,000 francs	38.94890594482422

this scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave grimaud for his part in it but on reflection he hated him more and more being convinced he had some evil motive for his conduct	107.81076049804688
the cardinal writes better than i thought	85.1895751953125
well out of the five or six millions which form your real capital you have just lost nearly two millions which must of course in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune to follow out my simile your skin has been opened by bleeding and this if repeated three or four times will cause <unk> pay attention to it my dear monsieur <unk>	97.0407485961914

but at the street gate porthos was talking with the soldier on guard	78.6075439453125
the officer leaned forward looked at her in his turn and appeared surprised to see that face just before so beautiful distorted with passion and almost hideous	72.61288452148438
but it seems you have come back rich my boy continued the tailor looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which dantès had thrown on the table	75.51341247558594

my father said haydée raising her head was that illustrious man known in europe under the name of ali <unk> pasha of yanina and before whom turkey <unk> albert without knowing why started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of haydée at this moment she appeared like a <unk> evoking a spectre as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man to the news of which all europe had listened with horror	63.45790481567383

and you my dear companion said he you speak of the <unk> countesses and princesses of others <unk> i spoke of them because porthos talked of them himself because he had paraded all these fine things before me	77.5478286743164
you had only read a line or two said d <unk> read the letter again from the <unk> willingly said aramis	57.3533935546875
the first person that struck him on his entrance was aramis planted near a great chair on castors very large covered with a canopy of tapestry under which there moved enveloped in a quilt of brocade a little face youngish very merry somewhat pallid whilst its eyes never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively intellectual and amiable	130.14100646972656
gentlemen said he leave me alone with patrick and <unk> is that you de winter	50.825130462646484

you do not know with whom you have to deal <unk> peppino made a sign and the youth hastily removed the fowl	37.24565124511719
this important task was just completed as they arrived at the countess s box	45.84208297729492
he bounded like a chamois cocking his carbine as he went and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the traveller	49.58566665649414
the happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my father s stead that would save us <unk> your mother would die of <unk> my poor mother said albert passing his hand across his eyes i know she would but better so than die of <unk> are you quite decided albert yes let us <unk> but do you think we shall find the count at home he intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at <unk> they ordered the driver to take them to no	65.14041137695312

<unk> was just the woman to walk with in the plain st. denis or in the fair of st. germain in company with athos porthos and aramis to whom d <unk> had often remarked this	61.229774475097656
she took me away without speaking	73.36163330078125

the cardinal exaggerated as i <unk> but pray sir continued aramis who seeing his captain become appeased ventured to risk a prayer do not say that athos is wounded	113.57255554199219
d <unk> rose and taking a letter from his <unk> presented it to raoul	31.425874710083008

uncertainty is worse than <unk> go on with the lights said the inspector	76.98299407958984
athos chose a black coat which gave him the appearance of a respectable citizen	31.193994522094727
to delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh offense	85.38237762451172
my own service said d <unk>	25.471569061279297

this house isolated from the rest had besides the main entrance another in the rue de ponthieu	51.024776458740234
consequently the procureur is very active in the affair and the prefect of police very much interested and thanks to that interest for which i am very grateful they send me all the robbers of paris and the neighborhood under pretence of their being <unk> s murderers so that in three months if this continues every robber and assassin in france will have the plan of my house at his fingers ends	84.40434265136719

i swear <unk> do not waste time in swearing said d <unk> let us gallop if our horses will <unk> and the travelers buried their <unk> in their horses flanks who thus vigorously stimulated recovered their energies	76.88541412353516
at that moment planchet put his head modestly in at the half-open door and told his master that the horses were ready	30.797367095947266

besides do you know what is our situation and whether mazarin s arrest would not be rather an encumbrance than an advantage say at once you disapprove of my <unk> i think you ought to do nothing since you exacted a promise from these gentlemen not to let mazarin know that we were in <unk> i have entered into no engagement and consider myself quite free	86.7242660522461
my dear sir said monte cristo i understand your emotion you must have time to recover yourself	28.899744033813477
at first athos supported the association for a time with his own means	100.62047576904297
in losing sight of his guardian whom he had quitted gazing after him in front of the royal <unk> raoul spurred on his horse in order not only to escape from his own melancholy reflections but also to hide from <unk> the emotion his face might betray	73.95940399169922
almost before the key had turned in the lock and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse dantès whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him hurried back to the abbé s chamber and raising the stone by pressing his head against it was soon beside the sick man s couch	70.7437515258789

i took a week to go another to return four days of quarantine and forty-eight hours to stay there that makes three weeks	67.20601654052734
why did you talk of a regiment athos	54.15280532836914
on his part the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect	35.95315170288086
and therefore my dear monsieur <unk> if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that i have come and tell her with what <unk> whether he spoke seriously or in jest since it was evident that under existing circumstances d <unk> was the only man who could relieve the queen s uneasiness <unk> went without hesitation to announce to her this strange embassy and as he had foreseen the queen gave orders to introduce monsieur d <unk> at once	53.556358337402344
if you heard the cry of mad dog you would take your <unk> would unhesitatingly shoot the poor beast who after all was only guilty of having been bitten by another dog	95.60941314697266

barrois asked mademoiselle valentine <unk> nodded his head	82.88556671142578
raoul sprang from his horse to which he left the charge of its own preservation and in three or four strokes was at the gentleman s side he seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water the animal began to breathe again and as if he comprehended that they had come to his aid redoubled his efforts	50.72726821899414
i shall kill <unk> can not help it	38.20001220703125

the carriage had been twenty minutes behind the time appointed	43.78740310668945

her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so for were it once discovered by her father and mother all would be lost	81.61431884765625
it was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act	74.17788696289062

aramis porthos and d <unk> drew their chairs near him	41.7322883605957
there only then remained porthos and <unk>	143.1510772705078
this caused so rapid and complete a diversion from the attack that d <unk> s adversary while the latter turned round to face this shower of blows sheathed his sword with the same precision and instead of an actor which he had nearly been became a spectator of the <unk> part in which he acquitted himself with his usual <unk> muttering nevertheless a plague upon these gascons	81.6628189086914
