d <unk> saw those tears and much disturbed softened he threw himself at her feet	1.1717493534088135
it was thus athos found at home resources which he did not expect	1.1513899564743042
the man whom he had seen seated on a fence had got down and was still pacing the street but strange as it appeared he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the champs-élysées or by the faubourg saint-honoré his attention was engrossed with what was passing at the count s and his only aim appeared to be to discern every movement in the dressing-room	2.1899914741516113

the noble and distinguished air of athos those flashes of greatness which from time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant companion in the world that forced and cynical gaiety that bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the rarest <unk> qualities attracted more than the esteem more than the friendship of d <unk> they attracted his admiration	2.8424367904663086

the cardinal exaggerated as i <unk> but pray sir continued aramis who seeing his captain become appeased ventured to risk a prayer do not say that athos is wounded	1.4414862394332886
do not let us do things in a hurry	1.0679943561553955
athos assisted by porthos who lifted him up like a feather arrived at the top	1.1663748025894165
<unk> had it would seem made good use of his money for he was newly clad	1.2163758277893066
in fact the sack of la rochelle and the assassination of three of four thousand huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed would resemble too closely in 1628 the massacre of st. bartholomew in 1572 and then above all this this extreme measure which was not at all repugnant to the king good catholic as he was always fell before this argument of the besieging <unk> rochelle is impregnable except to famine	2.5076794624328613
this humble picture would have but little interest for you accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious but such as we are we have experienced bitter <unk> and god has poured balm into your wounds as he does into those of all who are in affliction said monte cristo <unk>	2.0393810272216797

guard the prisoners well i beg of <unk> the sergeant made a sign as much as to say he did not understand french and d <unk> tried to make him comprehend by signs and gestures	1.473304271697998
it was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting half bitter that franz s ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous yet <unk> voice that had addressed him in the grotto of monte cristo and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the colosseum	1.8792507648468018
sir said he here is monsieur d <unk> s <unk> but i did not tell you there would be an answer stupid said athos	1.2315064668655396
and yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the crowd	1.2512418031692505
therefore athos had invented the phrase <unk> <unk>	1.1088014841079712
ah said monte cristo taking it from her hand	1.052915096282959
then the tunnel will be discovered the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry i uttered will be questioned	1.3235048055648804

at the end of the piece étienne entered and announced to eugénie that the horses were to the carriage and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her visits	1.3466830253601074
because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who caused the failure of our <unk> and yet said porthos neither of them had any advantage over us	1.4266374111175537
when this speech was arranged villefort turned to dantès	1.1092231273651123
could you not procure us a few of those nice little rabbits and some of those delicious partridges of which you used to make <unk> at the <unk>	1.3792331218719482
this was all that m. de <unk> wanted	1.0694262981414795
i hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler with the severe discipline on board would have a salutary effect on his character which was now well-nigh if not quite corrupt	1.5192127227783203
yet thither it was that dantès guided his vessel and at monte cristo he arrived at the close of the second day his boat had proved herself a first-class sailor and had come the distance from genoa in thirty-five hours	1.6336042881011963
however it does not signify he has a letter of credit on me so i must see him when he requires his <unk> then throwing himself back in his carriage <unk> called out to his coachman in a voice that might be heard across the road to the chamber of <unk> apprised in time of the visit paid him monte cristo had from behind the blinds of his pavilion as minutely observed the baron by means of an excellent <unk> as <unk> himself had scrutinized the house garden and servants	2.847831964492798

she is going to leave her house said the steward	1.0615746974945068
selim had also recognized him but the brave young man only acknowledged one duty which was to obey	1.2579169273376465
but bear in mind that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment as it is known you belong to a suspected <unk> alas madame returned villefort my profession as well as the times in which we live compels me to be severe	2.213517427444458
they might have been supposed to be following tracks so observant were they wherever they went	1.208258867263794

to save yourselves to scamper away to <unk> is good for the king s musketeers porthos and aramis trembled with rage	1.2501317262649536
all at once he uttered a terrible cry	1.0854660272598267
zounds he said i do not suppose there is a more contented man at this moment in all the kingdom than yourself you are right my lord duke answered the officer i do not know any <unk> sight on earth than a well covered table and when added to that he who does the honors is the grandson of henry iv. you will my lord duke easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure one <unk> the duke in his turn bowed and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of grimaud who kept behind la <unk>	3.2571067810058594
i maintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name my social position and my <unk> you are completely mistaken sir said monte cristo coldly who felt the perfidious <unk> of the young man and understood the bearing of his words you only acquired my protection after the influence and fortune of your father had been ascertained for after all who procured for me who had never seen either you or your illustrious father the pleasure of your acquaintance <unk> of my good friends lord wilmore and the abbé busoni	2.8390135765075684
this morning being ignorant that i should have the honor of seeing your majesty i encumbered myself with this dress but you will find me none the less a man devoted to your majesty s service in whatever way you may see fit to use me. the abbé d <unk> resumed de winter is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to his majesty king louis <unk> of whom i have spoken to you <unk> then turning to athos he continued and this gentleman is that noble comte de la fere whose high reputation is so well known to your <unk> gentlemen said the queen a few years ago i had around me ushers treasures armies and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my service	4.5872297286987305
the day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain	1.6146495342254639
yes yes murmured he i have often felt regret for the victim but never the very slightest remorse for the <unk> athos shook his dead doubtfully	1.362070083618164

he then went straight to the door and knocked murmuring i will go myself and be caught in the mousetrap but woe be to the cats that shall pounce upon such a mouse the knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased steps approached the door was opened and d <unk> sword in hand rushed into the rooms of m. <unk> the door of which doubtless acted upon by a spring closed after him	2.6109044551849365

vain and indiscreet it was as easy to see through him as through a crystal	1.2252005338668823
however among all the incoherent details given to me by the abbé busoni and by lord wilmore by that friend and that enemy one thing appears certain and clear in my <unk> in no period in no case in no circumstance could there have been any contact between him and me. but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe	2.247347831726074

upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of five minutes he found the abbé seated upon a wooden stool leaning his elbow on a table while <unk> whose animosity seemed appeased by the unusual command of the traveller for refreshments had crept up to him and had established himself very comfortably between his knees his long skinny neck resting on his lap while his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the traveller s face	2.6448724269866943

lord de winter passed before the door without stopping and they heard the noise of his footsteps soon die away	1.168386697769165
when you arrived madame de <unk> had already been panting for breath some minutes she then had a fit which i took to be simply a nervous attack and it was only when i saw her raise herself in the bed and her limbs and neck appear stiffened that i became really alarmed	1.885283350944519
i gave it away in a night of love as it has been given to <unk> d <unk> became pensive in his turn it appeared as if there were abysses in milady s soul whose depths were dark and unknown	1.583389401435852

the others my lord the <unk> heard his name by chance for before fighting us these four gentlemen told us their names the second was called the comte de la fere	1.3996413946151733
i say that according to all probability i shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of la rochelle and that it would be far better that you should appoint there either monsieur de condé monsieur de <unk> or some valiant gentleman whose business is war and not me who am a churchman and who am constantly turned aside for my real vocation to look after matters for which i have no aptitude	2.4035472869873047

a moment later he came down again holding in his hand the small shagreen case which he opened to assure himself it contained the diamond <unk> to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in then as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket he deposited it in his red handkerchief which he carefully rolled round his head	2.141247034072876

the little old man remained at the coach door the coachman took care of his horses the lackey held the <unk>	1.2285702228546143

count he inquired have you any relations no sir i am alone in the <unk> so much the <unk> why asked monte cristo	1.2536230087280273
a tall young man with light hair clear gray eyes and thin and compressed lips dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold buttons a white <unk> and a tortoiseshell <unk> suspended by a silken thread and which by an effort of the <unk> and zygomatic muscles he fixed in his eye entered with a <unk> air without smiling or speaking	2.079256296157837
she had already decided upon seeing him and urging his immediate departure when on the very evening of coming to this decision mme	1.3184746503829956

well exclaimed franz and the sailors in unison	1.0987073183059692
monte cristo took the glass drank half its contents and then presented it to valentine who smiled and swallowed the rest	1.2493408918380737
courted by my step-mother who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom admired by my father who says he has never before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed idolized by edward who notwithstanding his fear of the count s large black eyes runs to meet him the moment he arrives and opens his hand in which he is sure to find some delightful present <unk>	2.384737253189087
ali and his master conveyed the wounded man into a room	1.1316152811050415
believe me madame i had entirely forgotten <unk> but it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend madame de villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me. <unk> this time at least i do not deserve your thanks	1.9638148546218872

to lose a year two years three years is to talk of an eternity to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal perhaps to return when d <unk> and his friends happy and triumphant should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered <unk> were devouring ideas that a woman like milady could not endure	2.154324531555176
the world will think you abandoned and poor for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven were she to keep up an appearance of opulence	1.4064273834228516
d <unk> then remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility till he came to this unlucky city of <unk>	1.2540196180343628
they began by walking through the apartments many of which were fitted up in the eastern style with cushions and divans instead of beds and pipes instead of furniture	1.4438663721084595

but no matter we must trust in <unk> as soon as the plank was withdrawn the captain took his place at the tiller and made a sign to one of the sailors who <unk> in hand began to push out from the labyrinth of boats in which they were involved	1.7280329465866089
she opened the drawer and found a key and understanding that was what he wanted again watched his eyes which turned toward an old <unk> which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless documents	1.6356533765792847
this was fulfilling the intentions of monsieur porthos who had desired us to be so careful of this letter was it not nearly so. well monsieur do you know who this great lady is no i have heard porthos speak of her that is <unk> do you know who this pretended duchess is	1.8101407289505005
then with his knife he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood it was thus that pinelli the famous sculptor had commenced	1.3412532806396484
as this was the height of d <unk> s worldly <unk> be it well understood from his desire of finding mme	1.267505407333374
then he added in a low tone yes that is the <unk> and then he again plunged into a train of thought the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile than it would have been by tears	1.4915635585784912

ah i have come now to what is most <unk> speak speak	1.1174226999282837
a <unk> placed on the <unk> threw some of its pale rays without and a shadow was seen for one moment on the balcony	1.3173015117645264
i can not comprehend what induced you to buy three therefore i only purchased two said aramis	1.235192894935608
well i shall rent a room in some respectable house wear a decent coat shave every day and go and read the papers in a café	1.382464051246643
the devil cried aramis you have a magnificent horse there <unk> yes replied porthos it is the one that ought to have been sent to me at first	1.2967767715454102
the boat moved off toward the left-hand shore of the lys bearing the guilty woman and the executioner all the others remained on the right-hand bank where they fell on their knees	1.5035877227783203
what then well he is a <unk> porthos looked at d <unk> in astonishment	1.127174735069275
why do not we go in with them asked porthos	1.0949602127075195
but now he said that you are a widower your wife s connection can not injure <unk> yes but understand me not being of a race of historic fame like the de <unk> who were content to be plain sirs or the <unk> who did not wish to be dukes all these people who are all either <unk> or comtes go before me at church in all the ceremonies and i can say nothing to them	2.4280645847320557
in this room at about ten of the clock in the morning the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness watching both doors and listening to every sound	1.5743054151535034
ah cursed basilisk it will be a happy day for me when i can cross something more than a look with <unk> the king is really very handsome said porthos and look too though he is a prisoner how carefully he is dressed	1.5916674137115479

you have <unk> yes but i got down to defend monsieur de comminges and my horse was taken away	1.1753512620925903
the bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps	1.1764953136444092
one day you acknowledged that you loved me and since that day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you for to gain you would be life to me	1.459764003753662
in the space of half an hour we shall know the emperor s answer	1.1354416608810425
de villefort is <unk> well he comes to fetch his wife and <unk> why so because madame de <unk> is just arrived in paris bringing the news of m. de <unk> s death which took place on the first stage after he left marseilles	1.551891565322876
the two friends having agreed to leave <unk> and grimaud at compiegne with the horses resolved to take post horses and having snatched a hasty dinner they continued their journey to louvres	1.4288746118545532
am i allowed to repeat it yes but cautiously tell one thing at a time and do not say i told <unk> why so because it is a secret just <unk> by whom the <unk> then the news <unk> at the prefect s last night	1.6585479974746704
there is not one who has not treated me as the master of the house <unk> only title i desire with respect to you there is not one in fact who would have dared to speak of me as i have spoken of them this day	1.5621169805526733
he was the man who had proposed to carlini the health of their chief and to whom carlini replied by breaking the glass across his face	1.332810640335083
can you recollect all that perfectly <unk> come at <unk> very <unk> and be upon your guard before my husband who is rather shrewd notwithstanding his seventy-six <unk> seventy-six years	1.4962987899780273
duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was gliding away so <unk> they had agreed to meet once a week about one of the clock at the residence of athos seeing that he in agreement with the vow he had formed did not pass over the threshold of his door	1.9399797916412354
uncertainty is worse than <unk> go on with the lights said the inspector	1.1876215934753418
no distraction could come to his aid his energetic spirit that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage	1.4197150468826294
turned around astonished that any one should dare to address him	1.140982985496521
the ballet at length came to a close and the curtain fell amid the loud unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience	1.336387038230896
oh work work <unk> passion my joy my delight <unk> is for thee to alleviate my sorrows and he convulsively grasped the hand of d <unk>	1.4289188385009766
this will teach you said d <unk> to treat the guests god sends you in a more courteous <unk> god	1.2369002103805542
speak said athos we can not see your signs	1.0888482332229614
<unk> and before dantès could open his <unk> he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the <unk> he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was the jailer disappeared taking with him the lamp and closing the door leaving stamped upon the prisoner s mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon	1.933172345161438
nothing then was altered in the plan and orders were given to get under weigh next night and wind and weather permitting to make the neutral island by the following day	1.5364658832550049
i had him so well at the point of my gun i should have sent a ball into his <unk> it is enough to have killed the mother said athos hoarsely	1.3649165630340576
but d <unk> still keeping on the defensive drew near to kitty s door	1.1573832035064697
take the diamond then and sell it it is worth fifty thousand francs and i repeat my wish that this sum may suffice to release you from your <unk> <unk> oh sir said <unk> putting out one hand timidly and with the other wiping away the perspiration which <unk> his brow oh sir do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a <unk> i know what happiness and what despair are and i never make a jest of such feelings	2.6145331859588623
after a moment s silence the lady inquired do you know my dear count she said that you are a very terrible reasoner and that you look at the world through a somewhat <unk> medium	1.4321858882904053
but <unk> looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed oh <unk> i see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me you still leave me the love which i have always <unk> ah yes most assuredly said the eyes of the paralytic for he closed them with an expression which valentine could not mistake	1.881988286972046
this would have been a method of reckoning time had not dantès long ceased to do so	1.2143653631210327
besides you must have something on the panels of your carriage to escape being searched by the <unk> officers	1.2042428255081177
presently he made such a sudden movement that i was paralyzed with fear	1.151617169380188
i knew you were gloomy and always brooding over some old history of the vendetta and i overlooked that in italy because in italy those things are thought nothing of	1.4484809637069702
in the meanwhile franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the count of monte cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to albert	1.3740140199661255
when this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of the brig s departure its route its landings and to all these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without hesitation	1.548580527305603
never till then had i placed any confidence in <unk> but now i can not help believing them valentine	1.2873916625976562
as to myself i shall go around to see athos for though i do not think his aid worth much one must with one s friends observe all due politeness said d <unk>	1.494436502456665
he was certainly the tall young man with light hair red beard black eyes and brilliant complexion whom his master had so particularly described to him	1.3547892570495605
it is not your fault my good ali said the count in the arabic language and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing either in voice or <unk> it is not your fault	1.5372031927108765
the balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be <unk> count said <unk> are you speaking seriously i never joke with bankers said monte cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced m	1.919863224029541
this is the last judge that is all	1.0721689462661743
besides i have lost nothing by this journey because i see <unk> yes replied anne but you know why and how i see you because insensible to all my sufferings you persist in remaining in a city where by remaining you run the risk of your life and make me run the risk of my honor	1.9170701503753662
if he lays his hand on the boat s edge i will cut it off regicide that he <unk> and i said porthos	1.2723219394683838
no we shall beat them by merely temporizing	1.112483263015747
then the pope and cæsar borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner	1.1469626426696777
the next day m. <unk> s valet came to d <unk> s lodging and gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres	1.1974903345108032
when this was done eugénie opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak	1.4055980443954468
one day the young shepherd told the count s steward that he had seen a wolf come out of the sabine mountains and prowl around his flock	1.349825143814087

fernand saw this and when he learned of the old man s death he returned	1.14896821975708
humph said <unk> this is the second time you have refused to dine with my mother it is evident that you wish to avoid <unk> monte cristo started	1.2887104749679565
that is unpardonable in a man of your age and who besides has such a pretty wife as <unk> oh lord	1.2431215047836304
luigi <unk> comes to take us and we take <unk> bring him back to rome and present him to his holiness the pope who asks how he can repay so great a service then we merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horses and we see the carnival in the carriage and doubtless the roman people will crown us at the capitol and proclaim us like curtius and horatius <unk> the preservers of their <unk> whilst albert proposed this scheme signor <unk> s face assumed an expression impossible to describe	3.216657876968384
if your friends are the more speedy you are to be saved if the satellites of the cardinal you are <unk> oh yes yes lost beyond redemption	1.3101105690002441
i entreat you to write to me for you form a part of my existence and if i may venture to tell you so i also feel anxious	1.3227322101593018
unwilling to injure them by praising them too highly he replied they	1.1790728569030762

to give your majesty s reply to those who await <unk> stay marechal i will not appear to parley with <unk> madame i have pledged my word and unless you order me to be arrested i shall be forced to <unk> anne of austria s eyes shot glances of fire	1.7264940738677979
idiot that i am though i have been trying to find it out for five years i never found it <unk> but i do not say it was the because of your imprisonment	1.3628787994384766
it was this idea that had brought dantès back to the circular rock	1.1603275537490845
then he raised the <unk> cautiously with his head and looked carefully around the chamber	1.135000467300415
the instant debray had touched the ground he was at the <unk>	1.1200613975524902
while madame de villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror and villefort with his head hidden in the bedclothes saw nothing around him d <unk> approached the window that he might the better examine the contents of the glass and dipping the tip of his finger in tasted it	1.7856022119522095
villefort violently unbuttoned his greatcoat which seemed to strangle him and passing his livid hand across his forehead entered his study	1.2821369171142578
then she threw herself upon her knees and began to pray	1.0949110984802246
then the figure from whom she could not detach her eyes and who appeared more protecting than menacing took the glass and walking towards the <unk> held it up as if to test its transparency	1.5355498790740967
it was not difficult to understand that he had gained the crown of his ambition and that the <unk> wand he brandished was in his eyes as honorable a distinction as the marshal s baton which condé threw or did not throw into the enemy s line of battle at fribourg	1.8708126544952393
as luigi spoke thus he left her	1.092347264289856
the old servant left the room and presently returned bringing with him a small casket	1.166812539100647
since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that i should give you <unk> thank you sir it will be well employed i <unk> cromwell turned as he was going	1.6697361469268799
my dear count allow me to show you the <unk> they passed silently into the <unk> and everyone took his place	1.2251991033554077
my friend said aramis take care our safety lies in our obscurity	1.1256520748138428
the other two gentlemen were unknown to him	1.0593713521957397
you would like one that sails as rapidly <unk> lightning interrupted mordaunt	1.2089709043502808
why did you not tell me so before	1.0731470584869385
stop yes doubtless replied d <unk> who had never been able to cram the first rudiments of that language into his head and who had by his ignorance driven his master to despair yes doubtless there is <unk> there certainly is one said m. de <unk> who had a tincture of literature and monsieur de <unk> was quoting it to me the other day	2.0035579204559326
it was rita s father who brought his daughter s ransom in person	1.1288641691207886
he heard hasty steps the creaking of a door people going and coming and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered saying here is the brazier <unk> there was a moment s silence and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where dantès was listening in horror	2.0817065238952637
i have an extraordinary means which i will not employ but in the last extremity to close your mouth or at least to prevent anyone from believing a word you may <unk> i mustered all my strength to reply to him with a burst of laughter	1.6328130960464478
she opened her eyes and saw the abbess accompanied by a young woman with light hair and delicate complexion who fixed upon her a look full of benevolent curiosity	1.3272604942321777
with the count of <unk> answered monte cristo	1.0622252225875854
athos and d <unk> said nothing but their silence seemed to imply consent	1.170014500617981
<unk> became livid a fearful agony pervaded her frame and she sank panting into the arms of porthos and aramis	1.2681273221969604
but as we have said he was active strong and full of presence of mind	1.1630760431289673
the baron appears thoughtful today said monte cristo to her are they going to put him in the ministry not yet i think	1.3192689418792725
<unk> looked at the two men one after the other the one brutalized by liquor the other overwhelmed with love	1.2527635097503662
he went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy and returned as late as possible in the evening	1.205945611000061
mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that d <unk> had seen and heard everything but he was pleased with his falsehood	1.2429542541503906
section 2. information about the mission of project <unk> project <unk> is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete old middle-aged and new computers	1.3420332670211792
and therefore when all paris was rejoicing in the expected return of the king appointed for the next day <unk> alone in the midst of the general happiness was dissatisfied he sent for the two men whom he was will not to summon when in especially bad humor	1.7118685245513916
while exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls they excited them secretly to quarrel deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine regret from the success or defeat of their own combatants	1.5544476509094238
madame he said you have wished to conquer the prince your <unk> is to say the greatest captain of the age and when women of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it	1.495801568031311
d <unk> translated this for the others	1.09396493434906
thanks to what aramis had told him d <unk> who knew already that porthos called himself du vallon was now aware that he styled himself from his estate de <unk> and that he was on account of this estate engaged in a lawsuit with the bishop of noyon	1.672357201576233
as to aramis he never played	1.080955147743225
oh no sir it was expressly forbidden but they eluded the vigilance of the guards and made a passage from one dungeon to the <unk> and which of them made this passage oh it must have been the young man certainly for he was strong and industrious while the abbé was aged and weak besides his mind was too vacillating to allow him to carry out an <unk> blind fools murmured the count	2.4232287406921387
the count cried a young voice that made athos start	1.1291024684906006
we have already at the station three gentlemen whose passports are under examination who are on their way to her majesty	1.2712985277175903

the governor of the <unk> was monsieur du tremblay the brother of the famous capuchin joseph that fearful favorite of richelieu s who went by the name of the gray cardinal	1.3840012550354004
therefore if you part with m. <unk> give me the refusal of <unk> by all <unk> that is not all give my compliments to your illustrious <unk> cavalcante of the cavalcanti and if by any chance he should be wishing to establish his son find him a wife very rich very noble on her mother s side at least and a baroness in right of her father i will help you in the <unk> ah ha you will do as much as that will you <unk> well really nothing is certain in this <unk> oh count what a service you might render me	3.266796350479126
you will bet for me and those gentlemen for monsieur <unk> by this arrangement d <unk> could nudge porthos with his knee and make signs with his eyes to athos and aramis	1.4067232608795166
the cardinal however did not unseal the letter at once but continued to turn it again and again in his hand then in accordance with his usual custom and judging from experience that few people could hide anything from him when he began to question them fixing his eyes upon them at the same time he thus addressed the messenger you are very young monsieur mordaunt for this difficult task of ambassador in which the oldest <unk> often <unk> my lord i am twenty-three years of age but your eminence is mistaken in saying that i am young	3.161686658859253

hold hold hold said athos wit his quiet tone that throw of the dice is extraordinary	1.2615859508514404
it is generally the case that what we most ardently desire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it or from whom we attempt to snatch it	1.504214882850647
and i must take care of it for him since i only lend him my <unk> and <unk> shall you do with him i leave him with you my friend	1.3157066106796265

the rooms had been fitted up in strict accordance with oriental ideas the floors were covered with the richest carpets turkey could produce the walls hung with brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture while around each chamber luxurious divans were placed with piles of soft and yielding cushions that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such as sought repose	2.4872348308563232

you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of project <unk> works	1.1204880475997925

at daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his room	1.097185492515564
then turning to ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned albert to approach nearer to her	1.4498834609985352

the monks had no longer an instant of repose	1.0879302024841309

i became alarmed as any prosecution might be attended with serious consequences	1.1873122453689575
and what did he say or rather do ali placed himself in the light so that his master might see him distinctly and then imitating in his intelligent manner the countenance of the old man he closed his eyes as <unk> was in the custom of doing when saying <unk> good he accepts said monte cristo	1.8684122562408447
recollect that parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage between myself and mlle	1.1912691593170166

lord winter was seated near an aperture arranged as a window to let in the night air his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon intermittently veiled as we before observed by heavy clouds	1.5856870412826538
villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration	1.1147233247756958

porthos regretted that he had not at once made the lady of the red cushion a princess	1.1615569591522217
then monsieur de beaufort who was so familiar with the interior of the palais royal though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal pictured to himself in his prison all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the minister s cabinet to the chamber of anne of austria monsieur de beaufort has escaped whilst saying that to himself monsieur de beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside breathing the air of the plains and the forests pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice i am free it is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls he saw la <unk> twirling his thumbs ten feet from him and his guards laughing and drinking in the <unk>	5.32052755355835

these attempts did not prevent the cardinal to whom his most inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery from making nocturnal excursions sometimes to communicate to the duc d angoulême important orders sometimes to confer with the king and sometimes to have an interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home	1.9656314849853516

this moment was frightful if i had any doubts as to my misfortune these doubts had vanished in an overwhelming reality	1.3114919662475586

milady therefore continued coloring her narrations more and more	1.1456899642944336
then he had eaten some without saying a word more <unk> therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the volga	2.2245476245880127
this loophole which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside to an opening through which a child could not have passed was for better security furnished with three iron bars so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoner s escape	2.0967648029327393

he judged that the match would be so much the less equal if athos and his companions were really plotting and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at command all his anger faded away into a smile	1.6651960611343384
they were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and sound	1.248272180557251
the duke had followed with anxiety la <unk> s unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his face	1.278220534324646

athos then arose from his chair girded on his sword enveloped himself in his cloak and left the hôtel	1.1795541048049927
monte cristo allowed a short time to elapse and then said it is singular baron but the same idea came across me the first time i came here it looked so gloomy i should never have bought it if my steward had not taken the matter into his own hands	1.7096480131149292
your hand athos and without waiting for the answer of the newcomer to this proof of affection m. de <unk> seized his right hand and pressed it with all his might without perceiving that athos whatever might be his <unk> allowed a slight murmur of pain to escape him and if possible grew paler than he was before	1.9855270385742188

then after dinner on the pretext of business he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living and the father and son previously informed that it was through <unk> the one was to receive his 48,000 francs and the other 50,000 livres annually were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker s servants so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon	2.532708168029785
i would not choose to see the man against whom i pleaded smile as though in mockery of my words	1.257571816444397
still further monsieur de <unk> gains ten thousand crowns a year he is therefore a great noble	1.191083550453186
but after he had gone about two hundred steps d <unk> stopped short alighted threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of planchet and took the pistols from his <unk> to fasten them to his girdle	1.4561123847961426
during this time he occupied himself in making figures with his watch by his side	1.1657657623291016
four large vessels recently built had just been launched	1.1487659215927124

dantès went on looking from time to time behind and around about him	1.1626777648925781
in this ledger was made out an exact <unk> of his affairs	1.1486278772354126
franz replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish the <unk> and that he had lost sight of him in the via <unk>	1.2527211904525757
athos entered without the least mistrust and took out two <unk> to pay the bill	1.1838581562042236
he was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world even life itself	1.8557244539260864
in a moment he restrained himself so powerfully that the tempestuous heaving of his breast subsided as turbulent and foaming waves yield to the sun s genial influence when the cloud has passed	1.537055253982544
there only then remained porthos and <unk>	1.090377688407898
villefort traversed the antechamber cast a side glance at dantès and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him disappeared saying bring in the <unk> rapid as had been villefort s glance it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate	1.7769696712493896
he was a man of twenty-five or six and held a piece of cloth which being a tailor he was about to make into a <unk>	1.2557594776153564
oh attend to it valentine i entreat <unk> but no said valentine no i tell you it is all past and it was nothing	1.3137576580047607

here <unk> spoke to one of the subalterns asking how matters were progressing	1.194932222366333
m. de <unk> would doubtless give him good advice as to the whole affair	1.135757327079773
two other men descended after <unk> forming the rearguard and pushing <unk> whenever he happened to stop they came by a gentle declivity to the intersection of two corridors	1.4635459184646606
he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street pacing the chamber with restless steps stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels then to cast an anxious glance on ali but the regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his <unk> proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation	2.40498423576355
at that period buckingham was an ally and not an enemy	1.1267123222351074

dantès drew back and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to terror	1.1389713287353516
meantime d <unk> had thrown himself upon the other soldier attacking him with his sword	1.1414916515350342
the carriage was put in motion as slowly as a funeral car	1.1374510526657104
besides as m. de <unk> saw the queen almost daily he might be able to draw from her majesty some intelligence of the poor young woman whom they were doubtless making pay very dearly for her <unk> to her mistress	1.480429768562317
but instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eyes brilliant as carbuncles and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolf s or jackal s	1.8035248517990112
the monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more for he exclaimed eagerly go on i know nothing as yet when you have finished your story god and i will <unk> oh father continued the executioner without opening his eyes as if he feared on opening them to see some frightful object it is especially when night comes on and when i have to cross a river that this terror which i have been unable to conquer comes upon me it then seems as if my hand grew heavy as if the cutlass was still in its grasp as if the water had the color of blood and all the voices of <unk> whispering of the trees the murmur of the wind the lapping of the <unk> in a voice tearful despairing terrible crying to me place for the justice of god delirium murmured the monk shaking his head	6.455791473388672
i was a witness of the last hours of charles i. poor king	1.1245512962341309

one day when they were talking over their plans for the future they heard two or three reports of firearms and then suddenly a man came out of the wood near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks and hurried towards them	1.6149693727493286
i am very sorry for what you tell me said the governor replying to the assurance of the doctor that the old man is really dead for he was a quiet inoffensive prisoner happy in his folly and required no <unk> ah added the turnkey there was no occasion for watching him he would have stayed here fifty years i will answer for it without any attempt to <unk> still said the governor i believe it will be requisite notwithstanding your certainty and not that i doubt your science but in discharge of my official duty that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is <unk> there was a moment of complete silence during which dantès still listening knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time	4.533601760864258
art thou dumb cried the duke	1.070054531097412
dantès ordered the helmsman to put down his helm in order to leave la <unk> to starboard as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or three knots	1.3739101886749268
good answered grimaud and he went right to the prisoner	1.114135980606079
here edmond was to undergo another trial he was to find out whether he could recognize himself as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years	1.327700138092041
the count and ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of spanish wine then monte cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels which enabled him to see into the adjoining room	1.5035276412963867
yes why because in the first place they transfer from the vessel to their own boat whatever they think worth taking then they bind the crew hand and foot they attach to everyone is neck a <unk> ball a large hole is chopped in the vessel s bottom and then they leave her	2.064385175704956

yes and that is all settled only it will be an infamous shame and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter	1.2463915348052979

villefort therefore gained nothing save the king s gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the legion of honor which he had the prudence not to wear although m. de blacas had duly forwarded the brevet	1.6883995532989502

morrel held out his hand to her	1.0602869987487793
the quick eager glance of la <unk> followed him as he ascended while <unk> on the contrary turned his back and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him	1.4424452781677246

he bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to <unk> and affectionately to monte cristo	1.1311475038528442

then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the executioner	1.6614819765090942
alone and free to act as he wished the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern placed it on a stand then went straight to the <unk> felt the lock and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing	1.7360155582427979
that of the home department or of the observatory oh no i should find there people who would force me to understand things of which i would prefer to remain ignorant and who would try to explain to me in spite of myself a mystery which even they do not understand	1.7389076948165894

this lady said the count speaking to ali in the arabic language is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives but the boy refuses saying you are too <unk> ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy on whom he gazed without any apparent emotion but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced eye of monte cristo that the arab had been wounded to the heart	2.5600855350494385

sometimes when the cardinal always on horseback like the lowest <unk> of the army cast a pensive glance over those works so slowly keeping pace with his wishes which the engineers brought from all the corners of france were executing under his orders if he met a musketeer of the company of <unk> he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner and not recognizing in him one of our four companions he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction	2.8611562252044678

in turning the corner of the rue montmartre in order to reach the rue <unk> and the hotel de la chevrette where he had appointed porthos to meet him he saw at one of the windows of the hotel that friend himself dressed in a sky-blue waistcoat embroidered with silver and gaping till he showed every one of his white teeth whilst the people passing by admiringly gazed at this gentleman so handsome and so rich who seemed to weary of his riches and his greatness	2.469494342803955

no doubt she fancied the count would speak to her while on his side the count thought she was about to address him but both remained silent and after a mere bow monte cristo directed his steps to albert who received him cordially	1.6190241575241089
at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness	1.1218260526657104

but when the cowardly <unk> spat in the face of the captive monarch athos grasped his dagger	1.2414599657058716
m. de la <unk> approached him and made him inhale some salts which recalled him to life	1.1744681596755981
well three days after that you talked politics with m. debray and you fancied from his words that don carlos had returned to spain	1.3007148504257202
sir said villefort in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorical periods and of which they can not or will not divest themselves in society sir the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my thanks	1.9299606084823608
her maiden name was de <unk> and her first husband was colonel the marquis of <unk> i have not the honor of knowing madame <unk> but i have already met m. lucien <unk> ah indeed said <unk> and where was that at the house of m. de <unk> ah	1.5781831741333008
milady as athos had foreseen on finding the two men that awaited her made no difficulty in following them	1.2418421506881714
the first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness	1.462843894958496
franz congratulated albert who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited	1.2191426753997803
i say that valentine is dead replied d <unk> in a voice terrible in its solemn calmness	1.174118161201477
how i have suffered said milady in that harmonious voice which like that of the ancient <unk> charmed all whom she wished to destroy	1.2977300882339478
it was that another partook of his <unk> another partook of his <unk> another was to die before him	1.2093186378479004
when <unk> turned around he saw behind him la <unk> paler and trembling more than ever	1.1880919933319092
no my pride is to see the accused pale agitated and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my <unk> renée uttered a smothered exclamation	1.452322006225586
after dinner morrel usually went out and used to take his coffee at the club of the <unk> and read the <unk> this day he did not leave the house but returned to his office	1.3972870111465454
the monk cried the host where is the monk grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the courtyard	1.2169257402420044
he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his master s wishes and had already gone to fetch one	1.4104140996932983
not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said lord wilmore he is a <unk> hatred evidently inspired the englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avarice	1.487865924835205
well said the coadjutor on seeing him you are in disgrace then abbé this was the orthodox phrase	1.2577630281448364
at length milady could hold out no longer she broke the silence	1.138020396232605
they are only four a joyous smile lighted porthos s face	1.1298679113388062
and will you sign the contract i see no objection to that my scruples do not go thus <unk> well since you will grant me no more i must be content with what you give me	1.4496650695800781
what a dreadful <unk> a blow	1.0596991777420044
monte cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of ali pasha and knowing everything he had advised <unk> to write to yanina	1.2609623670578003
then said albert you became the property of this man <unk> no replied haydée he did not dare to keep us so we were sold to some <unk> who were going to constantinople	1.3768126964569092
but three weeks had already passed and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of mademoiselle <unk> to the count andrea cavalcanti	1.6610476970672607
these men were shopkeepers who had arms to lend to those who had none	1.150723934173584
yes monsieur replied d <unk> here it <unk> ah ah	1.0771845579147339
the face of the first was lost to parry in the darkness but as the second turned around and placed his finger on his lips parry started back in amazement	1.3389277458190918
at that moment bazin entered with the spinach and the omelet	1.1318901777267456
what has he done madame said d <unk>	1.0626449584960938
the gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight but they were forced when the door was open to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voices	1.4360188245773315
sir you know well i would risk my life for <unk> thou <unk> add that thou hast risked it planchet	1.255446434020996
go he added and make yourself agreeable to monsieur la <unk> and tell him that you suit me in all <unk> grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a deputy	1.597555160522461
i do not very well know	1.0458290576934814
the young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the chevalier d <unk> two officers in the parisian forces rushed at that instant on raoul but aramis protected him with his sword	1.4467647075653076
i was then obliged to come back again	1.080000638961792
at the same time continued d <unk> notwithstanding your forty thousand francs a year and perhaps even for the very reason that you have forty thousand francs a year it seems to me that a little coronet would do well on your carriage hey yes indeed said porthos	1.5917842388153076
it is a gift from my beautiful englishwoman or rather <unk> i am convinced she was born in france though i have not questioned <unk> that ring comes from milady cried athos with a voice in which it was easy to detect strong emotion	1.5859873294830322
we are going to execute your <unk> may heaven prosper you replied the dying man with an accent of gratitude impossible to describe	1.2800413370132446
thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that albert required	1.2402229309082031
it was the way in which he spoke	1.0634242296218872
where asked porthos filling a second glass of wine	1.0869460105895996
take pity on me then and go	1.0823590755462646
the two <unk> waited without but as if they likewise mistrusted each other they kept their respective distances	1.2118067741394043
at their approach planchet came out leading the two horses	1.121539831161499
come speak my worthy corsican speak what do you wish me to say i will help you	1.2034306526184082
the shortest follies are best my dear <unk>	1.0968931913375854
villefort is no longer at marseilles he is now at <unk> i am no longer surprised at my detention murmured dantès since my only protector is <unk> had m. de villefort any because of personal dislike to you none on the contrary he was very kind to me. i can then rely on the notes he has left concerning you <unk> that is well wait patiently <unk> dantès fell on his knees and prayed earnestly	2.318275213241577
meantime night came on rapidly and with night my terrors increased	1.180105209350586
what do you mean beauchamp oh yes do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the minister s said beauchamp placing his <unk> in his eye where he tried to make it remain	1.4543061256408691
there are yet five days left five days are more than i require	1.1387332677841187
why you sell yourself body and soul to the demon the devil for money no to the <unk> it is the same thing cried the young woman	1.3432979583740234
<unk> at one time he thought he was saved for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice to the two gendarmes he is not here but venturing to peep he perceived that the latter instead of retiring as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement were watching with increased attention	1.8237242698669434
now that i expect nothing now that i no longer entertain the slightest hopes the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of <unk> and he remained again motionless and thoughtful	1.4422502517700195
make me understand once for all that you are trifling with my happiness that my life or death are nothing to you	1.2901064157485962
come tell me all the good fortune that has befallen <unk> god forgive me said the young man for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others but heaven knows i did not seek this good fortune it has happened and i really can not pretend to lament it	1.802359938621521
however the vessel and the swimmer <unk> neared one another and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him	1.4160010814666748
there were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the catalans and eight days after the wedding they left <unk> did you ever see mercédès again inquired the priest	1.3732653856277466
the house as i said is between the court and the garden in this way do you see andrea drew the garden the court and the house	1.2834141254425049
we have made a <unk> wager which could not have been foreseen and of which i defy anyone to divine the true because	1.2964566946029663
but this unexpected <unk> unheard-of fortune sufficed you no longer when you once possessed it you wished to double it and how <unk> a murder	1.3734896183013916
i was not so in my youth i was not so on the night of the betrothal when we were all seated around a table in the rue du cours at marseilles	1.3295615911483765
you are a hundred times too <unk> begone then find them instantly and let all be done tonight	1.2389317750930786
in an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the most vigorous sources abandoned her she sank into a large easy chair with her arms crossed her head lowered and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her	1.7240183353424072
three days passed thus during which his prayers were frequent if not heartfelt	1.1922461986541748
<unk> it well understood that the fifty louis which i send are equally for aramis as for <unk> you as <unk> athos smiled and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear	1.4726001024246216
horticulture seemed however to have been abandoned in the deserted <unk> and where cabbages carrots radishes peas and melons had once flourished a scanty crop of <unk> alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation	1.686235785484314
he stood with his arms folded apparently as calm as any man could be in such circumstances	1.201489806175232
<unk> said the cardinal not turning round for having whistled he knew that it was his <unk> who was behind him what musketeers are now within the palace the black musketeers my <unk> what company <unk> s <unk> is there any officer belonging to this company in the <unk> lieutenant d <unk> a man on whom we can depend i <unk> yes my <unk> give me a uniform of one of these musketeers and help me to put it <unk> the valet went out as silently as he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded	3.1094412803649902
the lackeys followed their masters and the chamber was left solitary with its broken window its open door and its smoky lamp burning sadly on the table	1.4167945384979248
do you fear he will not understand <unk> oh we have so often spoken of you that he knows exactly how i talk to <unk> then turning to maximilian with an adorable smile although shaded by sorrow he knows everything i know said she	1.632879614830017
at half-past six the duke arose and said very gravely certainly caesar was the greatest man of ancient <unk> you think so my lord answered la <unk>	1.3941980600357056
the study does not take long it was acting as a supernumerary that was so <unk> and what is the pay a thousand francs <unk> it is <unk> no but then we are lodged as you <unk> monte cristo looked at the room	1.4967873096466064
on the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen who looked with anxiety at the stranger	1.2186545133590698
m. <unk> was introduced afresh and upon a sign from the cardinal the officer retired	1.1574095487594604
then began his travels his duels his caprices then the insurrection in greece broke out and he had served in the grecian ranks	1.3411898612976074
i am free then sir cried dantès joyfully	1.0889374017715454
the two nobles saluted each other politely for if no friendship existed between them there was at least esteem	1.2467719316482544
there was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream	1.1472238302230835
<unk> us see <unk> here they are replied the jeweller and he counted out upon the table 15,000 francs in gold and 30,000 francs in <unk>	1.2978118658065796
who should it be but he who watches while i sleep who labors while i amuse myself who conducts everything at home and <unk> france as in europe your majesty probably refers to god said m. de <unk> for i know no one except god who can be so far above your <unk> no monsieur i speak of the prop of the state of my only servant of my only <unk> the <unk> his eminence is not his holiness <unk> what do you mean by that monsieur that it is only the pope who is infallible and that this infallibility does not extend to <unk> you mean to say that he deceives me you mean to say that he betrays me	4.093250274658203
the count perceived at one glance madame <unk> at one end of the drawing-room m. <unk> at the other and eugénie in front of him	1.2593456506729126
why just remember what they said	1.0764691829681396
but will you be able to follow me oh yes your wound gives me pain but will not prevent my <unk> be ready then at the first <unk> milady shut the window extinguished the lamp and went as felton had desired her to lie down on the bed	1.6973508596420288
the two friends left alone remained silent face to face	1.0974658727645874
the young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court mounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first chamber	1.2822983264923096
d <unk> cried she is it you	1.0700920820236206
oh send for someone to whom i can denounce the wretch shall i write your deposition	1.2125569581985474
in this case milady would cross the garden and gain the village on foot	1.1709805727005005
i can not hope to be very fluent but i certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes and that would be quite as much as i should ever <unk> stronger grew the wonder of dantès who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings he added then if you were not furnished with pens how did you manage to write the work you speak of i made myself some excellent ones which would be universally preferred to all others if once known	3.8714895248413086
as was his custom d <unk> presented himself at milady s at about nine of the clock	1.1980375051498413
athos who heard milady s voice came sharply up	1.0727813243865967
thinking that porthos will be at last a baron and d <unk> a captain	1.1433963775634766
the last alternative seemed the most prudent so he waited until twelve of the clock	1.191848874092102
her lips were cold it appeared to d <unk> that he had embraced a statue	1.1565766334533691
then when they had finished they cast the earth over the corpse until the grave was filled	1.1835671663284302
thanks to the hopes which his master entertained of someday entering into orders he was always clothed in black as became the servant of a churchman	1.4172724485397339
he got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions arrived about midnight in the rue <unk> threw himself on his bed and slept soundly	1.348739504814148
can he <unk> and she stopped	1.0743526220321655
providence appears to me to have no share in this affair and happily so for instead of the invisible <unk> agent of celestial rewards and punishments i shall find one both palpable and visible on whom i shall revenge myself i assure you for all i have suffered during the last month	1.935078740119934
but his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of cromwell s	1.2290500402450562
but in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty	1.2080035209655762
<unk> as you left the choice of your costumes to me said the count to the two friends i have had these brought as they will be the most worn this year and they are most suitable on account of the <unk> sweetmeats as they do not show the <unk> franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the piazza del popolo presented and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre	2.849946975708008
monsieur du vallon that worthy gentleman for with the exception of yourself monsieur d <unk> there is not a man in france that i esteem and love so much as <unk> then my lord replied d <unk> pointing to the purse which mazarin still held if you love and esteem him so much <unk> me be it so	1.8403129577636719
why you told me he was a young man	1.0504826307296753
we must content ourselves then said beauchamp with rendering the count all the little services in our power	1.2192689180374146
athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the sea	1.3567942380905151
and besides he said going out of this chamber is not <unk> dear friend said porthos you appear to be in a somewhat better humor to-day than you were yesterday	1.3593688011169434
no replied the soldier tenacious in his credulity he has foretold many things which have come to pass for instance that the queen would have a son that monsieur coligny would be killed in a duel with the duc de guise and finally that the coadjutor would be made cardinal	1.7207300662994385
another flash illuminated all around them	1.0983790159225464
his remarkably noble and austere expression struck morrel who began his story with trembling	1.196685552597046
i do not know said the servant but the housemaid is in mademoiselle valentine s room perhaps she has emptied <unk> ask her said morrel translating <unk> s thought this time by his look	1.4601020812988281
above the room in which debray had been dividing two millions and a half with madame <unk> was another inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some interest	1.7238070964813232
monsieur said athos i have engaged two of my friends as seconds but these two friends are not yet come at which i am astonished as it is not at all their <unk> i have no seconds on my part monsieur said d <unk> for having only arrived yesterday in paris i as yet know no one but monsieur de <unk> to whom i was recommended by my father who has the honor to be in some degree one of his <unk> athos reflected for an instant	2.347766160964966
he planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor	1.1261258125305176
by means of the two windows looking into the street albert could see all that passed the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men who always want to see the world traverse their horizon even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare	1.768053650856018
villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from anger	1.2032774686813354
what would your excellency like and peppino placed his pan on the ground so that the steam rose directly under the nostrils of <unk>	1.329750895500183
they are yours take <unk> mordaunt delighted advanced porthos looking at d <unk> with <unk> astonishment	1.205613613128662
yes i hope so at least	1.0461745262145996
what do you decide on sir asked the notary of villefort	1.1044747829437256
do you know of what he died asked d <unk> placing his hand on <unk> s shoulder	1.1306110620498657
he is my friend and this morning offered to share his money with me as i shared mine with him	1.217881441116333
his speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule	1.486612319946289
they passed through a courtyard as they went full of soldiers and courtiers	1.1326711177825928
i will introduce you to him for it will be necessary he should know you as he is to pay your <unk> full dress said the major half aloud	1.3318854570388794
he did not take in the paper containing the defamatory article and had passed the morning in writing letters and in trying a horse	1.284159541130066
d <unk> bent forward ready either to attack or to stand on his defense	1.1641932725906372
my dear albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at torlonia s	1.2538236379623413
i myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these <unk> it seemed to me that i was in a dream and as it always happens in a dream i felt myself riveted to the spot	1.5711227655410767
you abuse my cookery because you dine at the table d <unk> of the hôtel des princes or the café de paris	1.258661150932312
thanks for the comparison said albert with a bow	1.1066359281539917
these details will guide her on her part and on your return i shall perhaps have some good news to tell you	1.2856611013412476
well he found us on his road and will not be baron this time	1.1674555540084839
some traveller seems impatient said the host	1.1048460006713867
really if the house had not belonged to the father-in-law of the procureur one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had been <unk> villefort who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him here took one and drank it off	1.9064522981643677
it is well said monte cristo	1.0199496746063232
yes <unk> can certainly say that much for myself continued the innkeeper fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbé s gaze i can boast with truth of being an honest man and continued he significantly with a hand on his breast and shaking his head that is more than everyone can say <unk> <unk> so much the better for you if what you assert be true said the abbé for i am firmly persuaded that sooner or later the good will be rewarded and the wicked <unk> such words as those belong to your profession answered <unk> and you do well to repeat them but added he with a bitter expression of countenance one is free to believe them or not as one <unk> you are wrong to speak thus said the abbé and perhaps i may in my own person be able to prove to you how completely you are in <unk> what mean you inquired <unk> with a look of surprise	6.612414360046387
a groom was rubbing them down near them were saddles and bridles	1.1504117250442505
it has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reappear	1.2427877187728882
at this moment the door of the minister s box opened and madame <unk> accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by lucien debray who assiduously conducted them to their seats	1.3307950496673584
ah there you are marechal cried anne of austria joyfully	1.1051709651947021
now if i had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in reversion to his <unk> ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so <unk> it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal <unk> but could you not compromise matters and give up a portion of your fortune to her son how could i make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested valentine i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred consequently i have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul	4.929696083068848
with the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders to leave dantès where he was	1.1963167190551758
finally as the hour for her interview with the count approached milady had everything about her darkened and ordered kitty to return to her own chamber and introduce de <unk> whenever he presented himself	1.4853320121765137
we have experienced the ingratitude of the great as you well <unk> it is true replied d <unk>	1.160984992980957

he drew up for a minute threw a rapid glance around him and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket where it began playing with a pistol	1.2770403623580933
well my dear <unk> he said rest satisfied	1.0942236185073853

he came last clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented him	1.2777384519577026
he had only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet when the procureur s footstep was heard in the passage	1.2832728624343872

but he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy	1.2739115953445435
just as he was passing the count s box the door opened and monte cristo came forth	1.1527642011642456
several inns were visited by them several innkeepers questioned without a single clew being given to guide their inquiries when at montreuil athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate fingers	1.6576372385025024
then with a sigh poor haydée murmured he	1.1120887994766235

at his house rebellion could be planned with impunity for as we have said since that morning he had ceased to be the queen s <unk> as to raoul he had attended the duchess to her carriage where as she took her seat she gave him her hand to kiss then by one of those wild caprices which made her so adorable and at the same time so dangerous she had suddenly put her arm around his neck and kissed his forehead saying vicomte may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune then she had pushed him away and directed the coachman to stop at the hotel de luynes	3.7033867835998535

as for fernand himself he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned unable to rest he was among the first to quit the table and as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds he continued in utter silence to pace the farther end of the salon	1.9116545915603638
never had he been so well received	1.0915322303771973

to this dumb language which was so unintelligible to others she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid whose body could scarcely be called a living one but who nevertheless possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses	2.91728138923645

ah this letter gives me an <unk> capital idea	1.1229760646820068
when at last the blade had been entirely withdrawn a red froth issued from the mouth of the wounded man and a stream of blood spouted afresh from the wound when he at length drew breath then fixing his eyes upon grimaud with a singular expression the dying man uttered the last <unk> and expired	1.8098738193511963

but i do not see the count of monte cristo <unk> he is worn out said debray besides he could not well appear in public since he has been the dupe of the cavalcanti who it appears presented themselves to him with false letters of credit and cheated him out of 100,000 francs upon the hypothesis of this <unk> by the way m. de <unk> asked beauchamp how is morrel <unk> <unk> i have called three times without once seeing him	2.355414628982544

fortunately however he had not been taken the people believing that he had escaped by some back entrance retired and left him at liberty to retreat	1.33424973487854

madame <unk> returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for her	1.3567347526550293
as they were going down d <unk> laid his hand on the shoulder of their leader	1.1470838785171509
at the same time couriers started in every direction over england and europe to announce that charles stuart was the prisoner of oliver cromwell	1.303061842918396

what has become of monseigneur athos asked he	1.092912197113037
besides courage was out of the question here d <unk> had fallen into an ambush	1.1960020065307617

d <unk> was the youngest of all these men	1.0694621801376343
then came a skirmish the more terrible because it had no definite object the more melancholy because those engaged in it knew not for whom they were fighting	1.3858752250671387

at the expiration of a minute or two it appeared to d <unk> that m. <unk> made him a sign to approach	1.1938815116882324
had this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signified for when the lower classes alone complained the court of france separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the <unk> seldom listened to their voice but unluckily mazarin had had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments in the court of requests at a high price and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue and should any one of them chance to forfeit his post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss	7.284623622894287

he went direct to the bedford tavern and the host who recognized him was delighted to see him again with such a numerous and promising company	1.3622856140136719
charles having proceeded with aramis as with athos embraced them both	1.1528555154800415
they then advanced two and two and saluted each other politely	1.1141538619995117
are you quite alone inquired the guest as <unk> placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass	1.2202306985855103

at midnight the sentinel gave the alarm and in an instant all were on the alert	1.1867389678955078
these words of felton s passed like ice through her veins	1.142757773399353

the police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous lips	1.501397728919983
i was without a light in that room when the wind shook all the doors behind which i continually expected to see some spy concealed i trembled	1.3905372619628906

the house to which d <unk> and porthos conducted athos and aramis was the one assigned to them by general cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous evening	1.367266297340393
sir said d <unk> to villefort call mademoiselle valentine s maid if you <unk> villefort went himself to find her and d <unk> approached <unk>	1.3054887056350708

as soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance d <unk> remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain followed by his three friends directing their course as well as they could guess toward london	1.5625005960464478

the nurse having placed the beverage prepared by the doctor within reach of the patient and locked the door was listening with terror to the comments of the servants in the kitchen and storing her memory with all the horrible stories which had for some months past amused the occupants of the <unk> in the house of the king s attorney	1.946703553199768
are you still resolved to accompany me more determined than <unk> well then come <unk> franz and the count went downstairs accompanied by peppino	1.3112550973892212
oh as to his name i know nothing about it but if i were ever to meet him i should recognize him in an instant i will answer for it were he among a thousand <unk> the face of the commissary grew still darker	1.5723941326141357
here they found only one inn in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its reputation to our time and which is still made in that town	1.366938591003418
that will be for another <unk> he owed me for the councillor the <unk> but said porthos if he was not crushed <unk> ah	1.2420899868011475
then the count brought the taper to the window that it might be seen in the champs-élysées that a man was getting out of the window while another held a light	1.3501123189926147
<unk> you must know something about it	1.05744206905365
<unk> distributed this dish to the young men with the moderation of a good housewife	1.1713697910308838
that continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but likewise from a plan i have marked out with respect to <unk> d <unk> became more and more astonished	1.4525871276855469
he would have <unk> at this instant someone knocked at the door	1.0923497676849365
has morrel whom we know been killed	1.0939891338348389

call an officer of justice he said and stay close to me he added in a low tone	1.195034146308899
he crept from his hole and stood hidden by the black drapery beneath the scaffold	1.170926570892334
felton was indeed behind the door and had not lost one word of this scene	1.1473723649978638
d <unk> continued before god and before men i accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me in wine which she sent me from villeroy with a forged letter as if that wine came from my friends	1.5698803663253784
charles who is my prisoner may still have friends but i have none and with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by mordaunt	1.4266130924224854
and who is the assassin they asked together	1.096606731414795
porthos was resplendent with joy and pride	1.062569499015808
yes monseigneur but i told her she was wrong to talk about such things and that his eminence was <unk> hold your tongue	1.2580212354660034
contrary to custom this gentleman had not been watched for as the report ran that he was a person of high rank and one who would allow no impertinent interference his <unk> was strictly respected	1.5422533750534058
ha ha cried lord de winter ha ha	1.0705472230911255
i had vague perceptions of space traversed of the rolling of a carriage of a horrible dream in which my strength had become exhausted but all this was so dark and so indistinct in my mind that these events seemed to belong to another life than mine and yet mixed with mine in fantastic duality	1.9416931867599487
you mean to say then my dear monsieur la <unk> that unless monsieur de beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself into a little bird i will continue answerable for <unk> take care	1.393237829208374
i called you because you were running like a madman and i was afraid you would throw yourself into the sea said <unk> laughing	1.260741949081421
once on board we drop down the thames and in two hours are on the open sea	1.2180322408676147
monsieur abbé you are a great <unk> doubtless said aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed but moreover not to fail for in case of failure heads are in question not for our <unk> speak lower aramis said athos	1.7376731634140015
then a strange reaction took place he who had just abandoned 5,000,000 endeavored to save the 50,000 francs he had left and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of <unk> was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of madness	1.785902976989746
well you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says replied athos shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of pity	1.3238799571990967
<unk> <unk> of the cardinal monsieur de <unk> i am vexed with you this was the chance at which m. de <unk> waited for the king	1.2465136051177979
excellency cried the <unk> seeing franz approach the window shall i bring the carriage nearer to the palace accustomed as franz was to the italian phraseology his first impulse was to look round him but these words were addressed to him	1.6309276819229126
<unk> <unk> stopped him at the last-named sum	1.0906670093536377
it is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said i remember that <unk> <unk> and beauchamp looked at each other the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which <unk> had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued	1.9849326610565186
and so the good la <unk> made a festivity of the little supper with his prisoner	1.1981710195541382
one expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner if i had listened to you lord de winter had said to felton	1.308860421180725
d <unk> you are a great man and when you occupy monsieur de <unk> s place i will come and ask your influence to secure me an <unk> well i am in a maze said porthos do <unk> approve of what d <unk> has done <unk> indeed i do said athos i not only approve of what he has done but i congratulate him upon <unk> and now gentlemen said d <unk> without stopping to explain his conduct to porthos all for one one for <unk> is our motto is it not and <unk> said porthos	2.690669298171997
he took a seat and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary	1.1290950775146484
morrel took the purse and started as he did so for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself	1.2923985719680786
i will go <unk> then he descended a smile on his lips and murmuring that last word of human philosophy perhaps but instead of the darkness and the thick and <unk> atmosphere he had expected to find dantès saw a dim and bluish light which as well as the air entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks	3.0930352210998535
there are twenty-five bottles of it left all the rest were broken by my fall	1.1823581457138062
whilst mordaunt was making his way to cromwell s tent d <unk> and porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at newcastle	1.3661383390426636
eh he said to the <unk> eh <unk> caro this was another little piece of italian the baron had learned from hearing his daughter sing italian duets with cavalcanti	1.4154603481292725
if we only had some one to instruct us about the physical and moral topography of this castle	1.23306143283844
as for you raoul i am sure it is your fault some giddiness or <unk> no sir i assure you muttered raoul it is <unk> oh no no i declare it is not cried the young girl while raoul turned pale at the idea of his being perhaps the because of her disaster	1.7434407472610474
in short his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs while the rest of the rigid and <unk> features were utterly deprived of the power of participation	1.9527987241744995
one only chance was left me that of beseeching the magistrate before whom i was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the abbé busoni who had stopped at the inn of the pont du gard on that morning	1.5266056060791016
he had now leisure to look to his wound	1.0943598747253418
monte cristo watched him till he disappeared and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a picture which in sliding partly from the frame discovered to view a small opening so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawing-room now occupied by cavalcanti and andrea	1.9232732057571411
i understand replied porthos she has ordered relays of <unk> exactly so. and we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left my dear porthos you are really a man of most superior understanding said d <unk> with a look as if he spoke against his conviction	1.6788790225982666
milady opened the letter with eagerness equal to kitty s in bringing it but at the first words she read she became livid	1.2828984260559082
how he stares at him the insolent dog	1.0992645025253296
d <unk> who had unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point was not at more than three paces from it	1.2203208208084106
the drum immediately beat and the little troop advanced at charging pace	1.175255298614502
gradually the <unk> filled and some of our old friends made their <unk> mean debray <unk> and beauchamp accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army for m. de villefort moved in the first parisian circles less owing to his social position than to his personal merit	1.9934686422348022
no no continued <unk> if we resolve on such a step it would be much better to take as i now do this pen dip it into this ink and write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we <unk> and <unk> uniting practice with theory wrote with his left hand and in a writing reversed from his usual style and totally unlike it the following lines which he handed to fernand and which fernand read in an undertone the honorable the king s attorney is informed by a friend of the throne and religion that one edmond dantès mate of the ship <unk> arrived this morning from smyrna after having touched at naples and <unk> has been <unk> by murat with a letter for the usurper and by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist committee in paris	5.65130090713501
still <unk> he was scarcely forty-six years of <unk> possessed great elegance of form and was above the middle height his complexion was brilliant and beautiful his glance full of expression his nose though large was well proportioned his forehead broad and majestic his hair of a chestnut color was curled slightly his beard which was darker than his hair was turned carefully with a curling iron a practice that greatly improved it	2.499110698699951
well yes pretty well replied d <unk> and besides you see if they put us on trial if they cut off our heads they must meanwhile either keep us here or transfer us <unk> yes that is inevitable said porthos	1.562610387802124
you will find very few persons who will go and brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a <unk> or will administer to him in order to remove him from the surface of the globe on which we move with life and animation that quantity of arsenic of which we just now talked	1.801761507987976
there is half-past ten striking <unk> <unk> confess you have dreamed this and let us sit down to breakfast continued beauchamp	1.2623494863510132
in hôtels that do not flourish everything is in confusion and the traveler is a victim to the embarrassments of his host	1.2969906330108643
and you grimaud he said to his companion who had just come in after his round with d <unk> are you thirsty as thirsty as a <unk> was grimaud s laconic reply	1.4820423126220703
however you may look and see added the lackey raising the curtained entrance of the tent	1.2151974439620972
monte cristo shook it coldly according to his invariable practice	1.131453037261963
in case i should be killed said de guiche	1.062303066253662
villefort s impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead and franz was stupefied	1.2141814231872559
the number of lights had been intentionally diminished but the young woman could not conceal the traces of the fever which had devoured her for two days	1.320967435836792
how sire cried the young queen affecting surprise you are giving me then two more i shall have <unk> in fact the king counted them and the twelve studs were all on her majesty s shoulder	1.506523847579956
i bitterly reproach myself i assure <unk> well what does it signify valentine so long as i am satisfied and feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five minutes of your society or two words from your lips	1.693666696548462
the dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself with the deepest respect at the feet of monsieur de <unk> who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud but a frown succeeded and he bit his lips with vexation	1.757095456123352
two held poor assunta who unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners	1.4124021530151367
the next morning at the same hour the jailer came again	1.0712792873382568
to be overwhelmed with insults and ignominy	1.0977163314819336
great people only thank you for doing the impossible what is possible they say they can effect themselves and they are right	1.3198165893554688
well well my dear edmond continued the owner do not let me detain you	1.1610021591186523
i suppose that you think it necessary that i should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say gentlemen your servant <unk> is <unk> what does monsieur <unk> care think you whether i am thirsty or not it is a very expensive wine said <unk> shaking his head	1.7480489015579224
poor edmond he was cruelly deceived but it was fortunate that he never knew or he might have found it more difficult when on his deathbed to pardon his enemies	1.4062683582305908
you may think my departure strange and foolish said the young man you do not know how a paragraph in a newspaper may exasperate one	1.329979419708252
what magistrate would find or even venture to insinuate anything against this	1.1812189817428589
the young man knew quite well that after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping but he did not know that matters had reached such a point	1.5905317068099976
and what do you know about the state you talk of said mme	1.1145721673965454
oh sir she stammered i beseech you do not believe <unk> are you then a coward cried villefort in a contemptuous voice	1.2269489765167236
as he entered the chamber of his friend dantès cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels but nothing more than common met his view	1.4281198978424072
in a week remember you will no longer be performing your manoeuvres for practice but on a field of <unk> then suddenly in order not to give too uncomfortable an importance to this observation see raoul he resumed what a fine plain for partridge <unk> the young man stored in his mind the admonition whilst he admired the delicate tenderness with which it was bestowed	2.313180923461914
behold nebuchadnezzar exclaimed an old puritan soldier whose eyes flashed at the sight of the man they called the tyrant	1.27701735496521
what tenderness my sister but am i not your nearest relative demanded milady with a tone of the most touching ingenuousness	1.3115065097808838
i will circulate that saying be assured my dear fellow	1.1090415716171265
i have come therefore to discharge this duty and to express to you my overwhelming <unk> and as he said this the eye severe of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance	1.514116644859314
it was this gentleman said d <unk> bowing to the officer	1.0686330795288086
at the same instant aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his fallen enemy and forced him to ask for mercy	1.2851670980453491
this apparition was so strange and so solemn that everyone rose with the exception of carlini who remained seated and ate and drank calmly	1.3153550624847412
he struck his forehead on the ground and groaned	1.0761351585388184
how are you sir asked morrel with a sickness of heart	1.1244665384292603
whose is that letter of your mistress	1.076414704322815
no everyone would do <unk> my dear viscount you are dreadfully <unk> albert advanced towards eugénie smiling	1.2314889430999756
ah do not be angry i beg of you that would be useless you know what is agreed upon between you athos and me	1.2789798974990845
do you know monsieur de rochefort one of my bitterest <unk> faithful friend of cardinal <unk> i know that and we sent him to the <unk> said mazarin	1.286055326461792
the horses which were more kindly used than on the previous day stopped at arras at four of the clock in the evening	1.2562323808670044
when to-morrow evening if you like at what hour at ten in the evening if that suits you by that time we shall have <unk> <unk> there continued athos either peace or war will be decided honor at all events will be maintained alas murmured d <unk> our honor as soldiers is lost to us forever d <unk> said athos gravely i assure you that you do me wrong in dwelling so upon that	2.5353610515594482
to no one on my <unk> everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the island of elba and addressed to m. <unk> everybody except the person who gave it to me. and that was too much far too much murmured villefort	1.5866434574127197
plan of campaign d <unk> went straight to m. de <unk> s	1.1265482902526855
hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded	1.132428765296936
come ease me of my anxiety or else frighten me at <unk> lucien a great event has happened said the lady glancing <unk> at lucien m	1.3595694303512573
saved exclaimed the man with gray hair who also touched bottom	1.1648808717727661
what could be his intentions towards him	1.0680397748947144
though <unk> could not see peppino the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his occupation	1.226919174194336
<unk> stood at the door and porthos was inside the carriage	1.0908727645874023
from that moment we had no rest till we could find some trace in contemporary works of these extraordinary names which had so strongly awakened our curiosity	1.3932855129241943
d <unk> s plan was very simple	1.0498119592666626
if you will only agree to my request i promise you never to mention another word about <unk> the abbé smiled	1.2351999282836914
however as far as ali is concerned i can assure you the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your <unk> who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in <unk> really	1.5473054647445679
the chancellor made a profound reverence	1.0752382278442383
that woman had in all probability poisoned my brother and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me in my turn	1.2719210386276245
d <unk> examined the countenances of his companions which like that of athos wore an impression of deep anxiety and they continued their route as fast as their horses could carry them but without adding another word	1.5292999744415283
the fact is one can not remain thus with a sword hanging eternally over his head said athos	1.2184231281280518

d <unk> stood for an instant mute pensive and motionless then as he went in he saw the fair madeleine his hostess standing on the threshold	1.325761079788208
d <unk> was in a dolorous situation which he had not foreseen	1.1080467700958252
such news was decisive it destroyed in favor of the court the struggle commenced with parliament	1.2663224935531616

yes yes said the king caressing it with his hand yes my arthur thou art a fond and faithful <unk> after this little scene charles threw himself into the saddle and turning to athos aramis and winter said now gentlemen i am at your <unk> but athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which bordered the banks of the tyne and seemed to extend double the length of the camp	2.37483811378479
he forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the future	1.1739662885665894

aramis calmly drew his sword which he had carried between his teeth as he swam	1.1433615684509277
there was a moment at which he felt something like remorse	1.102041244506836
it appears to me you make dull jokes my dear said porthos	1.110316276550293
a capital blow you gave cried porthos	1.0945842266082764

i do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to <unk> would be to accuse her majesty queen anne of <unk> with the queen sir replied athos in his calm vibrating voice	1.429189920425415

when we show a friend a city one has already visited we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been	1.3892238140106201
then <unk> feeling that he was leaving him raised himself on his elbow and with a dying voice cried with great effort murder	1.275833249092102
you are one of those men who can comprehend certain matters and having understood them can act with <unk> such was cardinal richelieu s opinion my <unk> the cardinal interrupted mazarin was a great politician and therein shone his vast superiority over me	1.6666984558105469
then d <unk> rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see bazin turn down the rue de la <unk> and enter in the rue de la <unk> a respectable looking house and this d <unk> felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy beadle	1.6476582288742065
look at my eyes and you will see what no looking-glass has ever shown <unk> frank and honorable <unk> to this flow of words not perhaps in the best taste but characteristic of d <unk> whose principal object was to divert his opponent s attention mordaunt did not reply but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with d <unk>	2.193112850189209
he proposed to fernand to accompany him fernand agreed to do so deserted his post and followed the general	1.2472200393676758

he has taken part against his queen or rather against her minister	1.1407479047775269
at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead of stopping this time at the end of the rue <unk> drove up to the green door	1.3327538967132568
here and there on the walls of the staircase were reflected gigantic shadows which trembled in the flickering light of the <unk> till they seemed to reach to the vaulted roof above	1.4204341173171997
if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project <unk> electronic works in your possession	1.2586865425109863

is it not so eh who knows	1.0937350988388062

franz was less enthusiastic but the count exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less domineering	1.351686954498291
no one <unk> speak out then say what it was gaspard cried la <unk> do as you will you are <unk> if you take my advice you will hold your <unk> well wife replied <unk> i do not know but what you are right so you will say nothing asked the abbé	1.6081984043121338
ali mute and attentive brought the pipes and coffee and disappeared	1.1682029962539673
they ask where i was born i answer	1.0955867767333984
the next day mercédès came to implore the protection of m. de villefort she did not obtain it however and went to visit the old man when she saw him so miserable and heart-broken having passed a sleepless night and not touched food since the previous day she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him but the old man would not consent	1.9597669839859009
it is true that all was like a dream but it was not the less frightful	1.1455022096633911
i present to you he said monsieur le chevalier d <unk> lieutenant of his majesty s musketeers a devoted friend and one of the most excellent brave gentlemen that i have ever <unk> d <unk> received the compliments of those who were present in his own way and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at athos	1.8059940338134766

lucien had found time preparatory to the count s arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to madame <unk>	1.2271153926849365
then why did you smile why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself <unk> do you want me to go away ah no no	1.3251867294311523

he inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to make	1.1525423526763916
in fact the minister who in the plenitude of his power had been unable to unearth napoleon s secret might in despair at his own downfall interrogate dantès and so lay bare the motives of villefort s plot	1.5566540956497192
take away vasiliki said my father to his <unk>	1.1150401830673218
a fine prize friend mordaunt we have both myself and monsieur du vallon taken two knights of the garter nothing <unk> but said mordaunt looking at athos and aramis with bloodshot eyes these are frenchmen i <unk> i faith i do not know	1.620070219039917
it seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished everyone	1.1568635702133179
<unk> and was as we have said close to her he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief which he picked up as was his habit and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and aramis to cut each other s throat	1.8082603216171265
therefore he knew nothing either of the enemy s numbers or of those in command or of the purpose of the army	1.263885259628296
they drew near to the sloop	1.0675947666168213
in passing before d <unk> he recognized his former master	1.107802391052246

the superior met her milady showed her the cardinal s order	1.1203442811965942
madame <unk> presented her cheek to him	1.0762794017791748
now not a second to lose for a second lost will perhaps save them	1.1604305505752563
the cardinal therefore rose to open it	1.0692309141159058
shall i swear to you sir asked maximilian	1.0801734924316406
not before me behind me. but with what asked the duke	1.132389783859253
the whole of the second story was set apart for maximilian it was precisely similar to his sister s apartments except that for the <unk> he had a <unk> where he received his friends	1.4075242280960083
all these cloaks gray or black were raised behind by the point of a sword or before by the barrel of an <unk> or a musket	1.3142085075378418
and is he aware of the danger he has been in i think <unk> then it will be but charitable to inform him	1.2652870416641235
de villefort he said will you conduct the baroness <unk> villefort complied and they passed on to the dining-room	1.2324937582015991
the affair at armentieres whispered d <unk>	1.0692821741104126
but said d <unk> shall we not pursue that woman later said athos	1.1302133798599243
she will soon pass she is already late	1.0868479013442993
she then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of genius receive in great crises in supreme moments which are to decide their fortunes or their lives	1.4484498500823975
bravo monsieur grimaud said athos and now take this	1.107953667640686
remember your <unk> in five minutes the party entered the courtyard and d <unk> led the prisoner up the great staircase and across the corridor and <unk>	1.329664707183838
he soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to chantilly so that he might be in paris in five or six hours	1.3858187198638916
what is the matter then he asked	1.0421500205993652

perform your duty in camp i will do mine elsewhere	1.1529133319854736

chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his sword	1.1192419528961182
sire the usurper is arming three ships he meditates some project which however mad is yet perhaps terrible	1.3384208679199219
in a second de guiche had sprung before him and barred his passage	1.1423639059066772
but even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago which is generally but too <unk> but who then is this assassin this murderer let me also ask you a question	1.6615644693374634
but i dined at m. de villefort s and lawyers always give you very bad dinners	1.2013959884643555
he was we repeat handsome young and bold he spoke of love like a man who did love and was anxious to be loved in return	1.352146863937378
as for you viscount continued monte cristo to <unk> you are more fortunate than the government for your arms are really beautiful and speak to the imagination	1.3182307481765747
on his part the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect	1.1171550750732422
curiosity prevailed over prudence and profiting by the preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have plunged the two personages now on the scene he stole from his hiding place and quick as lightning but stepping with utmost caution he ran and placed himself close to the angle of the wall from which his eye could pierce the interior of aramis s room	2.1943488121032715
today <unk> bless me i quite forgot the races	1.1341198682785034

villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business he soon however returned his whole face beaming with delight	1.3711316585540771
he had therefore set off at a furious rate from the rue <unk> and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the faubourg saint-honoré	1.272579312324524
he appeared to foresee all to divine all to anticipate all	1.1251424551010132
reload the muskets grimaud said athos and we gentlemen will go on with our breakfast and resume our conversation	1.2139209508895874

if i once went up those stairs	1.0877877473831177
meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was good	1.2001229524612427
in france the first fear of the king of england charles i. on learning of the death of the duke was that such terrible news might discourage the <unk> he tried says richelieu in his <unk> to conceal it from them as long as possible closing all the ports of his kingdom and carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army which buckingham was getting together had gone taking upon himself in default of buckingham to superintend the departure	2.7682418823242188
they talk of making him an <unk> <unk> and what are his claims to the peerage he has composed two or three comic operas written four or five articles in the <unk> and voted five or six years on the ministerial <unk> bravo viscount said monte cristo smiling you are a delightful <unk>	1.8201632499694824

monte cristo called the owner who immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a good fare	1.256012201309204
but when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found themselves in the open plain d <unk> who was completely ignorant of what was going forward thought it was time to demand an explanation	1.4660651683807373
<unk> therefore ask my own secrets and i will reveal them to you but those of <unk> is quite another <unk> very well said d <unk> i shall discover them as these secrets may have an influence over your life these secrets must become <unk> beware of what you do cried the young woman in a manner so serious as to make d <unk> start in spite of himself	2.0866589546203613
there is then the second point cleared up or nearly so said eugénie without the least confusion and with that masculine <unk> which distinguished her gesture and her language and you appear satisfied with the explanation	1.5753594636917114
suppose i were a soldier like you and ordered to carry a certain redoubt and you knew i must be killed in the assault would you not say to me as you said just now go father for you are dishonored by delay and death is preferable to shame yes yes said the young man yes and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure he said be it so my <unk> and he rushed out of the study	2.4895994663238525
she inquired if the baron was still at the castle	1.0828183889389038
having aroused the enmity of the sultan he was proscribed and put to death by treachery in 1822 at the age of <unk>	1.3022576570510864
heigh sir said d <unk> trying to laugh do you know we look very much like a flock of silly <unk> women	1.2698029279708862
it was at this period i learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by napoleon had bestowed on him a son named king of rome even in his cradle	1.5113011598587036
he grew deadly pale placed his hand upon his heart which was breaking and at once perceived all the treachery	1.231173038482666
would you like to know how matters have progressed	1.1267313957214355
accept my compliments your dinner has been a real feast	1.1119260787963867
d <unk> felt he had allowed himself to be carried away and that he had committed an error	1.166731595993042
franz and the count got into the carriage	1.0494846105575562
have i not explained your wishes <unk> said valentine addressing <unk>	1.1483429670333862
<unk> so then he exclaimed turning pale with anger seven conjoined and allied armies overthrew that man	1.261284589767456
athos is not a man to be thwarted he like porthos has obliged his peasantry to call him my lord and to dignify his <unk> place by the name of chateau	1.4038692712783813
and this bed with red hangings a bed visited by the goddess lucina	1.1677840948104858

the gratitude of anne of austria	1.0447810888290405
meanwhile <unk> continued on his way and crossing the pont neuf still driving the two sorry animals before him he reached the rue aux ours	1.3359626531600952
i was at school at the time and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the <unk> which would not prevent me said d <unk> if i knew where the duke of buckingham was from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the queen were it only to enrage the cardinal and if we could find means to play him a sharp turn i vow that i would voluntarily risk my head in doing <unk> and did the mercer rejoined athos tell you d <unk> that the queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter haberdasher she is afraid so. wait a minute then said aramis	3.761141061782837
monsieur de longueville is of royal blood madame said d <unk>	1.1050364971160889
what are you doing reverend sir	1.0539625883102417
d <unk> would have remonstrated at this but athos put his hand upon his shoulder with a smile and d <unk> understood that it was all very well for such a little gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince	1.6454565525054932
at the other end silent scarcely visible and like a shadow was a sentinel who was walking up and down before a grotto which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere	1.5829912424087524
oh ours is a theological quarrel replied aramis making a sign to d <unk> to keep secret the because of their duel	1.2910410165786743
<unk> let us understand each other said albert it is <unk> it not <unk> you are to be at no	1.1899311542510986
when he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the <unk>	1.116675615310669
as soon as these studs shall be in your possession inform me	1.1281709671020508
they entered the common hall and placed themselves at table	1.1038854122161865
and <unk> beautiful witty somewhat talented as the comic operas say and <unk> that is happiness <unk> do you call me unhappy <unk> seeing his daughter smiling and proud even to insolence could not entirely repress his brutal feelings but they betrayed themselves only by an exclamation	1.8687207698822021
the occupant of the box in which the greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed for he left his seat to stand up in front so that his countenance being fully revealed franz had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of monte cristo and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him	2.386861562728882
and when he had discharged his two pistols what a terrible noise he made with his sword	1.1879489421844482
the party was to take place at st. germain i believe and they had appointed to meet at the <unk> when they were disturbed by de <unk> <unk> <unk> and two other guardsmen who certainly did not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against the <unk> ah ah	1.7107677459716797
send me five hundred <unk> and four or five days after i have received them i shall be in <unk> on the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his customary question to him	1.407240390777588
this feeling lasted but for a moment	1.069146990776062
porthos fired the flash threw a gleam of light over the field of battle	1.1553574800491333
alas said milady i know it is so	1.0544171333312988
yes it is one of milady s bastards you laugh <unk> from habit that is all	1.1699206829071045

or have you forgotten them <unk> what has become of them i do not know we separated as you know	1.2122560739517212
<unk> repeated the count who seemed to hear the voice of the abbé answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his name	1.268530249595642
five minutes later he was in the rue des <unk>	1.0545761585235596
come come calm yourself my sweet girl	1.0716272592544556
he was convinced that lucien s visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the rue de la chaussée d antin	1.3810842037200928
he was thinking by himself and even seriously racking his brain to find a direction for this single force four times multiplied with which he did not doubt as with the lever for which archimedes sought they should succeed in moving the world when someone tapped gently at his door	1.905411958694458
as regarded her attainments the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person	1.5823156833648682
a new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd	1.1488229036331177
m. de <unk> approved of the resolution he had adopted and assured him that if on the morrow he did not appear he himself would undertake to find him let him be where he might	1.45516037940979
there is now a truce and a conference	1.0786311626434326
we and his majesty will lead the second	1.0766611099243164
we lost five men and the <unk> eight or <unk> <unk> said the swiss who notwithstanding the admirable collection of oaths possessed by the german language had acquired a habit of swearing in french	1.5083913803100586
four men disguised as workmen were to get the king out of prison and take him to greenwich where a vessel was <unk> and knowing all that your honor remained here far from the city tranquil and <unk> tranquil yes replied cromwell	1.7032803297042847
you would be no longer a lost child found but you would be looked upon as an upstart who had sprung up like a mushroom in the night	1.3086366653442383
there as in every spot where monte cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease	1.3346415758132935
i shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward m. <unk> i will suffer without complaint the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me but i shall remain firm in my determination and the world shall see which party has reason on his side	1.706379771232605
sir interposed <unk> i warn you that i can only swim in <unk> and i not at all said <unk>	1.2138193845748901
monsieur athos do me then the honor to accompany me you and your two friends and then i shall have an escort to excite envy in his majesty if we should meet <unk> the three musketeers bowed to the necks of their horses	1.508817434310913
divers descended in machines made expressly on the discovery into the bay where they were thrown but of ten three only remained the rest having been broken by the waves	1.4522744417190552
he decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand <unk> at which he estimated the prisoners	1.21944260597229
you have restored my courage by a single word go i will rejoin <unk> milady ran up to her apartment quickly she there found rochefort s lackey and gave him his instructions	1.4640973806381226
you have perhaps no money <unk> is too much said d <unk> smiling	1.108601689338684
now madame nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage said chatillon who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of athos	1.414930820465088
what we want replied one is to communicate to you the will of his highness	1.1854685544967651
there is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and milady s every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the <unk> that is exactly the reason i will not go said d <unk>	1.4335192441940308
that is more time than we want	1.0756727457046509
in an instant he was among the branches and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion	1.2733498811721802
how do you feel this morning he inquired	1.0722630023956299
franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to albert s request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon	2.2858431339263916
if she seduced your <unk> said she seduced him did you not <unk> if she caused his <unk> said that she caused his death yes repeated the executioner	1.3221321105957031
privately <unk> well i will remain with <unk> at this moment villefort returned followed by the lady s maid and after her came madame de villefort	1.2594733238220215
but be of good courage my lad in three days we shall be delivered from this creature and where i shall send her she can harm <unk> you hear him cried milady with vehemence so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven and that felton might understand she was addressing him	1.8316473960876465
as he struck the wall pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off and fell to the ground in flakes exposing a large white stone	1.4606081247329712
still further the jew told them that if they would sell it to him as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings he would give five hundred <unk> for it	1.368578553199768
signor <unk> remained silent a short time it was evident that he was musing over this answer which did not seem very clear	1.2588832378387451
mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about but he had with him a <unk> to help him to explore his mysterious strong box	1.4055417776107788
my lord i think we are in bad <unk> a man advanced to the door with a kind of scythe in his hand	1.1972017288208008
it will then be said of me that i died for the king so that i shall have performed my duty without the expense of an <unk> porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him tossing his head and repeating i shall follow up on my <unk> aramis anxious and negligently dressed said nothing	1.8618797063827515
i noticed them for their remarkable <unk> then how comes it said monte cristo with a frown that when i desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in paris there is another pair fully as fine as mine not in my stables at the look of displeasure added to the angry tone in which the count spoke ali turned pale and held down his head	2.3546295166015625
do i look so asked the baron rising and going a step backward	1.139974594116211
touches upon the strange effects a <unk> may have	1.112615942955017
immediately a brilliant light from the next room or rather from the palace adjoining shone upon the room in which he was gently gliding into his last sleep	1.3532921075820923
a day or two of rest will set me up and i hope i shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for <unk> a peculiar smile passed over dantès lips he squeezed jacopo s hand warmly but nothing could shake his determination to <unk> remain alone	1.9024747610092163
but monsieur <unk> are you aware that it is simply civil war you are proposing to me you have been preparing long enough my lord for it to be welcome to you <unk> never mind said the coadjutor you must be well aware that this requires <unk> and how many hours of reflection do you ask twelve hours sir is it too long it is now noon at midnight i will be at your <unk> if i should not be in wait for me. good	2.4493629932403564
in ten minutes d <unk> reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate the points and crossed bars of which were gilt	1.4048138856887817
you <unk> more <unk> yes sir i will give my attention to the <unk> i do not say that i await with pleasure his decision but i do await it	1.3313829898834229
come he said it is a warning from heaven	1.0847136974334717
ten leagues were passed and not a single word was uttered	1.1019638776779175
you are about to swear upon your honor and i upon my word and then it will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied	1.315449833869934
come your excellency the count added turning to franz here is luigi <unk> who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has <unk> franz approached the chief advancing several steps to meet him	1.5379562377929688
they had understood each other without speaking	1.0702100992202759
villefort looked at valentine as they said this	1.088245153427124
<unk> had once made a will against <unk> your <unk> favor of the poor in fact m. <unk> is spared because nothing is expected from him	1.4008007049560547
eugénie <unk> i can not in conscience therefore let you run down the speeches of a man who will one day say to me vicomte you know i give my daughter two <unk> ah this marriage will never take place said beauchamp	1.5690383911132812
monsieur <unk> you can find me without <unk> you understand and where i pray you near the <unk> at what hour about <unk> about noon	1.3034021854400635
monseigneur let your eminence be reassured	1.0904021263122559
as for grimaud he seemed more sullen than ever	1.0831670761108398
it also boasted of what in languedoc is styled a garden consisting of a small plot of ground on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests	1.447170376777649
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life	1.2271835803985596
with regard to athos he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at full gallop only instead of following the road he went across the fields urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to listen	1.488326072692871
now sir pray do not be offended at the question i am about to put to you as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron	1.3512881994247437
<unk> why should he doubt it said beauchamp to <unk>	1.103997826576233
what exclaimed the queen when the last of them had quitted the apartment you would yield to these limbs of the <unk> advocates to promote your majesty s welfare madame replied mazarin fixing his penetrating eyes on the queen there is no sacrifice that i would not <unk> anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual with her	2.057220697402954
we even joked very pleasantly if i remember rightly on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my arrest	1.3456459045410156
raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him and remembering the recommendation of athos he with the rapidity of lightning made his horse rear as the shot was fired	1.4296480417251587
de <unk> my brother s chamberlain yes <unk> he is at <unk> and writes me <unk> does he speak to you of this conspiracy no but strongly recommends m. de villefort and begs me to present him to your <unk> m	1.5554900169372559
the apparent reason at least said madame de villefort	1.0823925733566284
you <unk> <unk> why do you do so i smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own	1.4657213687896729
he remained there some time alone	1.0606940984725952
the water passed over his head and the sky turned gray	1.1068288087844849
madame said debray it is nearly six months since we have been associated	1.1025185585021973
a love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress dwells undoubtedly in some paternal hearts toward a son	1.3026314973831177
and what will he promise us said d <unk>	1.0776710510253906
who is he come come you will not tell me you do not know aramis this is the first time i ever heard his name <unk> it is the first time then that you ever went to that house <unk> and you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man no. by a musketeer no indeed it was not he then you came to seek not the least in the world	1.9296584129333496
draw if you please and <unk> not so if you please my good <unk> here at least	1.1811164617538452
he profited by this distraction to slip away among the crowd without even thanking the worthy priests who accompanied him	1.2548519372940063
however he like cæsar borgia knew the value of time and in order to avoid fruitless toil he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe struck the earth with the butt of his gun and finding nothing that appeared suspicious returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard	1.992534875869751
we have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this favor but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we can not <unk> have been guided by an invisible hand <unk> hand as powerful as that of an <unk> oh cried julie i have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand as i now kiss the purse which he has touched	2.2307491302490234

to have you as long as possible near me to hear your eloquent speech <unk> embellishes my mind strengthens my soul and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things if i should ever be free <unk> fills my whole existence that the despair to which i was just on the point of yielding when i knew you has no longer any hold over me and <unk> is my <unk> chimerical but actual	2.5297372341156006
athos and d <unk> watched their approach from the window	1.091639518737793
the rowers waited their oars half lifted out of the water like birds drying their wings	1.2146016359329224

they wished to carry him to the shore but when they touched him although under jacopo s directions he declared with heavy groans that he could not bear to be moved	1.38695228099823
night arrived i allowed it to become quite dark	1.123573660850525
the permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening and albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them	1.5883989334106445
besides how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at st. cloud opposite d <unk> s pavilion	1.501051902770996

milady possessed that great art so much studied by women of looking through her long eyelashes without appearing to open the lids	1.3155781030654907
the officer desired to have milady s packages pointed out to him and ordered them to be placed in the boat	1.2300446033477783
what a wrist you have reverend sir said <unk> stroking his arm all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it what a wrist silence	1.380944013595581

poor young man said monte cristo in a low voice it is then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and fourth <unk> meanwhile albert had revived and continuing to read he threw back his head saying florentin is your horse fit to return immediately it is a poor lame <unk> in what state was the house when you left all was quiet but on returning from m. beauchamp s i found madame in tears she had sent for me to know when you would return	2.9689102172851562

we are all invited my father madame de villefort and <unk> least i understood it so. when will it be our turn to think of these things	1.3394564390182495
but how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion	1.122186303138733
sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which i have been patiently listening for the last half hour	1.592689871788025
the queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister	1.1298648118972778
when the emperor returned he wrote implored threatened and so energetically that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a bonapartist	1.302869439125061
what is the use of following the alleys	1.0785222053527832
my english horse which has just disappeared amid a cloud of dust has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the things of the earth	1.3693108558654785
meanwhile the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the king s room attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men had stolen little by little toward the table and standing on tiptoe lounged watching the game over the shoulders of d <unk> and porthos	1.795729398727417

the steamer soon disappeared and in an hour afterwards as the count had said was scarcely distinguishable in the horizon amidst the fogs of the night	1.3074876070022583
fourteen years had changed the worthy merchant who in his thirty-sixth year at the opening of this history was now in his fiftieth his hair had turned white time and sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow and his look once so firm and penetrating was now irresolute and wandering as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person	2.3425192832946777

d <unk> and porthos went on meantime to paris	1.0749738216400146
now he was accustomed to walk with his fowling piece on his shoulder behind the hedges which border the roads and when he saw a catholic coming alone the protestant religion immediately prevailed in his mind	1.5431174039840698
he cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off teresa as nessus the centaur carried deianira	1.2346476316452026

the boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase it was evident that every precaution had been taken	1.291418194770813
if it is only to be recognized why the saddle will suffice for that it is quite remarkable enough	1.2027627229690552

porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running around	1.1101359128952026
he went straight to the queen and in an altered voice said why madame have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs when you know it would give me so much gratification the queen cast a glance around her and saw the cardinal behind with a diabolical smile on his countenance	1.7432881593704224
in about ten minutes d <unk> appeared at the door followed by the inseparable porthos	1.1281144618988037

if mazarin is an italian i am a <unk> and d <unk> dressed himself in an instant	1.1454695463180542
in the long run a man knows more about politics than a woman particularly such as like you monsieur <unk> have conversed with the cardinal	1.329956293106079
at ten minutes past five albert entered overjoyed	1.0933144092559814
but the sound of the clock had not died away when germain announced his excellency the count of monte <unk> the involuntary start everyone gave proved how much <unk> s narrative had impressed them and albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion	1.7824755907058716
said monte cristo you do not appear to be in the possession of your <unk> provided i understand your perfidy sir and succeed in making you understand that i will be revenged i shall be reasonable enough said albert furiously	1.4647120237350464
