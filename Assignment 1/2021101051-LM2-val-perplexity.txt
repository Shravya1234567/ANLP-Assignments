how was it that a presentiment did not warn mercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her	115.18154907226562

upon gaining this advantage d <unk> was near uttering a cry of surprise it was not aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor it was a woman	72.72627258300781
there only his memory returned to him	130.6767120361328
i saw the soldier s shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head so quickly for i was fearful he might also see me. well inquired dantès	138.5830078125
luigi took her arm beneath his own and led her to the door of the grotto	47.095733642578125

but the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the nearest gate	151.5478973388672

but to grieve my <unk> disturb my grandmother s last <unk> you are right said morrel calmly	153.66278076171875
why did she not ask from any one of us a home instead of from mazarin	167.5520477294922

milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury screaming in a formidable way	329.1160888671875

in that case in the name of heaven continued he throwing him a pistole tell me what you have seen and i will pledge you the word of a gentleman that not one of your words shall escape from my <unk> the old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the young man that he made him a sign to listen and repeated in a low voice it was scarcely nine of the clock when i heard a noise in the street and was wondering what it could be when on coming to my door i found that somebody was endeavoring to open it	58.280113220214844
in his regiment maximilian morrel was noted for his rigid observance not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier but also of the duties of a man and he thus gained the name of the <unk> we need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it and did not even know what it meant	161.64837646484375
now let us return to the first	28.713544845581055

where can my eyes have been not to have seen you during the two hours of the sermon i was within two paces of you monsieur replied the procurator s wife but you did not perceive me because you had no eyes but for the pretty lady to whom you just now gave the holy <unk> porthos pretended to be confused	77.28657531738281
at length he raised his head fixed his eagle look upon that loyal open and intelligent countenance read upon that face furrowed with tears all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a month and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was in that youth of twenty-one years before him and what resources his activity his courage and his shrewdness might offer to a good master	317.41015625
in the place of the fowl a dish of <unk> beans made its <unk> enormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show themselves	291.3479309082031
in addition to this d <unk> possessed that invincible stock of resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart endure nothing from anyone but the king the cardinal and monsieur de <unk> he flew then rather than walked toward the convent of the carmes <unk> or rather <unk> as it was called at that period a sort of building without a window surrounded by barren <unk> accessory to the <unk> and which was generally employed as the place for the duels of men who had no time to lose	172.8507843017578
there was a moment s silence <unk> was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body	38.165992736816406
his heart ceased beating he closed his eyes and leaned upon the table	122.02843475341797
he arose and bowed to the four friends whose eyes were fixed on charles while harrison emptied his glass without the slightest misgiving	184.59249877929688
still she felt her pulse and finding it throb violently she remembered that the best method of <unk> such illusions was to drink for a draught of the beverage prepared by the doctor to <unk> her fever seemed to cause a reaction of the brain and for a short time she suffered less	322.0234375

you were always a merry companion my dear d <unk> he said and your witty gascon fancy has not deserted you	167.10108947753906
at the sight of these men the englishman started and advanced a step then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment	111.68724822998047
the chevalier raised his head saw the two young women and without stopping waved his hand in a friendly way to milady	105.78643035888672
d <unk> thought this could not last long and continued to look with all his eyes and listen with all his ears	81.24529266357422
i have told you that i am prepared for <unk> the two travelers knocked at the door	29.387088775634766

as soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from laporte and ran to meet her	56.833168029785156
in a few minutes through all the doors down all the staircases by every exit everyone hastened to retire or rather to fly for it was a situation where the ordinary <unk> <unk> even the best friends are so eager to offer in great catastrophes <unk> seen to be utterly futile	173.52157592773438
and when i have signed he said what is to be my guarantee my word of honor sir said athos	96.25287628173828

waiting for whom <unk> without answering pointed to villefort with something of the gesture macbeth uses to point out <unk>	1471.22119140625
why do you not join our party my dear beauchamp	84.15518188476562
what to do there would be a very simple means very <unk> tell me what to wait concealed in the neighborhood and assure yourself who are the men who come to ask for <unk> but where can i wait oh there is no difficulty in that	100.09632110595703

<unk> are at this time shaken and it is to little purpose for devoted hearts to serve the interests of princes	243.46847534179688
the next morning <unk> awoke late though he went to bed so early he had not slept well for five or six nights even if he had slept at all	95.03529357910156
no fifteen thousand are not enough <unk> can not again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand <unk> no replied andrea dryly no i can not i do not think you understand me replied <unk> calmly i said without your laying out a <unk> do you want me to commit a robbery to spoil all my good <unk> yours with <unk> both of us to be dragged down there again it would make very little difference to me said <unk> if i were <unk> i am a poor creature to live alone and sometimes pine for my old comrades not like you heartless creature who would be glad never to see them <unk> andrea did more than tremble this time he turned pale	158.8731689453125

do you think his uncle de winter would have brought up that young viper	155.7884521484375
now here we are obliged to own that andrea ought to have felt remorse but that he did not	119.94743347167969
i only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought <unk> you do not mention those who aided and <unk> the deed said <unk>	170.77615356445312
de <unk> continued beauchamp looked at this woman with surprise and terror	58.014183044433594
ah haitians <unk> is quite another thing	144.12393188476562
leave him to build up the future for you and i venture to say you will confide it to safe <unk> oh replied the wretched woman mournfully shaking her head the prosperity of which you speak and which from the bottom of my heart i pray god in his mercy to grant him i can never enjoy	126.16231536865234
this was m. morrel s wish also who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent but the old man resisted and cried so that they were actually frightened	182.5324249267578
when d <unk> arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the <unk> athos had been waiting about five minutes and twelve of the clock was striking	69.38338470458984
unfortunately there are great words as there are great men i have measured them	186.07192993164062
after continuing some time in profound meditation the young man suddenly exclaimed i have found what you were in search of faria started have you indeed cried he raising his head with quick anxiety pray let me know what it is you have discovered the corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here <unk> in the same direction as the outer gallery does it not <unk> it <unk> and is not above fifteen feet from it about <unk> well then i will tell you what we must do	141.8400421142578
this morning being ignorant that i should have the honor of seeing your majesty i <unk> myself with this dress but you will find me none the less a man devoted to your majesty s service in whatever way you may see fit to use me. the abbé d <unk> resumed de winter is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to his majesty king louis <unk> of whom i have spoken to you <unk> then turning to athos he continued and this gentleman is that noble comte de la fere whose high reputation is so well known to your <unk> gentlemen said the queen a few years ago i had around me <unk> treasures armies and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my service	116.11820983886719
either i misunderstand you or you are very shameless you only speak thus because you are overheard coolly replied milady and you wish to interest your jailers and your <unk> against me. my jailers and my <unk>	270.1456604003906
under his assumed name in order that he might be appointed to the post he subsequently held	183.481689453125
he consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of <unk>	550.5143432617188
what magistrate would find or even venture to insinuate anything against this	408.96417236328125
pardon me said albert i was not aware that he was a prince	19.319480895996094
yes said milady lord de winter and now you can understand it all can you not	45.46916580200195
this was to go himself to m. de la <unk>	50.80345916748047
athos who was very expert in all bodily exercises passed with d <unk> to the opposite side and challenged them but at the first effort he made although he played with his left hand he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion	145.503662109375
the room was whitewashed as is the custom in prisons but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner though a stove a bed a chair and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous furniture	420.72796630859375
if paris has <unk> to complain of who has not some wrongs to be <unk>	269.2553405761719
when he had finished he said my mistress said she should expect you sir as soon as you had finished <unk> i am going to <unk> and villefort with his papers under his arm and hat in hand directed his steps toward the apartment of his wife	59.454750061035156
pray let me know who you really are the stranger smiled a melancholy smile	156.9973907470703
and this bed with red hangings a bed visited by the goddess <unk>	787.7039184570312
he seemed to be quite overcome	54.612571716308594
as soon as that important business is concluded i will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to madame <unk> i dare not return with those dreadful horses said madame de villefort	114.7668685913086
she was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with that of the lover of her heart and yet milady at the same time detested and despised this weak fanatic	104.04331970214844
that we are not able to say but at all events we have seen by the anterior developments of this story that buckingham had the advantage over him and in two or three circumstances particularly that of the diamond studs had thanks to the <unk> of the three musketeers and the courage and conduct of d <unk> cruelly mystified him	114.93679809570312
as to d <unk> who as yet knew nobody in the capital he only found one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the guards	149.3989715576172
the dim light the profound silence and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour and still more by her own conscience all combined to produce a sensation of fear the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work	185.2915496826172
he had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the <unk> was the general s body which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after <unk> that he was dead	73.05924987792969
and you really understand none of these signals none at <unk> and have you never tried to understand them never	266.5484313964844
and pray what was this quarrel about these fellows were drunk said athos and knowing there was a lady who had arrived at the cabaret this evening they wanted to force her <unk> force her door said the cardinal and for what purpose to do her violence without doubt said athos	147.31698608398438
sir said she i perfectly understand my grandfather s meaning at all <unk> that is quite true said barrois and that is what i told the gentleman as we walked <unk> permit me said the notary turning first to villefort and then to <unk> permit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself can not proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility	130.8118133544922
honor to man this <unk> of nature this king of the creation and the count burst into a laugh a terrible laugh that showed he must have suffered horribly to be able thus to laugh	236.81019592285156
he hesitated a moment he was so very desirous to complete the poor devil s punishment	104.1214370727539
the duc de chatillon commanded the centre	127.69775390625
oh real enough from anxiety doubtless <unk> any rate they postponed the matter for two months	775.99658203125
because he had boasted that he would perforate the stranger with whom you left him in dispute whereas the stranger on the contrary in spite of all his <unk> quickly threw him on his back	128.14877319335938
they threw themselves into each other s arms embraced tenderly and returned together to the house	141.1550750732422
he had made up his mind to write to her the next day	31.142318725585938
with an instinctive hatred of matrimony she suffered andrea s attentions in order to get rid of <unk> but when andrea urged his suit she betrayed an entire dislike to him	316.3495788574219
what are these things replied anne with <unk> dignity extending toward the open coffer an arm despite the lapse of years still beautiful	792.38916015625
he had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of father	188.389404296875
come and open then cried d <unk> to the man with the <unk> taking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with the handle	86.95159912109375
the ball fired by porthos s foe went through the throat of his horse which fell groaning	123.53153228759766
this war may not only bring great catastrophes upon england and france but misfortune upon you my lord for which i should never console myself	171.17620849609375
but asked madame <unk> looking at her husband with uneasiness how could that prevent m. de <unk> in this simple way madame replied monte cristo the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence i therefore sent them to the king s attorney	115.74031829833984
faith sir said raoul smiling although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair you are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to me	134.5944366455078
at the second turn a bunch of fresh violets thrown from a carriage filled with harlequins indicated to albert that like himself and his friend the peasants had changed their costume also and whether it was the result of chance or whether a similar feeling had possessed them both while he had donned their costume they had assumed his	232.22898864746094
is that she mamma asked eugénie almost opposite to us with that <unk> of beautiful light hair yes said madame <unk> that is she	187.72886657714844
well it is impossible but that master aramis that <unk> bloodhound and athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our retreat	545.3984375
i say that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension i am accustomed not to dwell on that thing but to pass to another	254.9534454345703
well answered the old man by closing his eyes but his appearance manifested increasing uneasiness	117.31057739257812
this however was nothing to a sculptor like <unk> he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it	339.92529296875
there is nothing compromising in the name of a town	65.87345886230469
this is the kind of difficulty which i wished to represent to you my dear count	42.393192291259766
they directed their horses to the city	98.24021911621094
he had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the <unk> of any attempt at escape	124.01241302490234
the because was not in dantès but in providence who while <unk> the power of man has filled him with boundless desires	310.2475280761719

d <unk> resolved to try and enter the louvre	74.5940933227539

certainly women alone know how to <unk> said monte cristo to himself glancing at madame <unk> who was smiling on the procureur and embracing his wife	101.07645416259766
at the sight of the little letter the heart of d <unk> bounded for he believed he recognized the handwriting and although he had seen that writing but once the memory of it remained at the bottom of his heart	59.85634994506836
i am endeavoring he thought to make this man happy i look upon this restitution as a weight thrown into the scale to balance the evil i have wrought	339.2848205566406
an instant after the guardsman descended in his turn	54.9722900390625
meanwhile barrois had returned for the first time to old <unk> who having heard the noise in the house had as we have said sent his old servant to inquire the because on his return his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger	104.06902313232422
the three valets passed without accident	95.04232025146484
then said d <unk> letting his arm fall with discouragement it is useless to struggle longer	211.54945373535156

mazarin gazed at each of them with an <unk> stare recognized them and let drop his lantern uttering a cry of terror	161.43724060058594
whilst we thought you indifferent to our sorrows which you could not share without crime you alone among us have discovered what we were searching for in vain	319.855224609375
there was a great deal going on that morning and many <unk> persons at the palais <unk> persons pay very little attention to women and madame <unk> crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer	236.9952392578125
suppose a <unk> should pass and he blew out the light	208.69537353515625

i have fought too long they have sold me they shall give me up and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their <unk> sire said athos perhaps a king should act thus but not a husband and a father	244.1452178955078
d <unk> and porthos pointed to their dusty and torn dresses but the cardinal shook his head	154.10275268554688
after passing through the porte saint denis athos looked at raoul s way of riding and observed take care raoul	244.03428649902344

morrel had long thought of <unk> but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource	160.9056396484375
and yet said aramis i am somewhat of porthos s <unk> is the king accustomed to give you such reasons	96.25761413574219
then as lord leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue which seemed to come from heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner athos and aramis dragged the king from the <unk> assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent	177.61085510253906
