let us see the ground floor said <unk>	1.063822865486145

suddenly the boat leaned on one side beneath a new and unexpected weight and grimaud uttered a shout of joy every one turned around and beheld athos livid his eyes dim and his hands trembling supporting himself on the edge of the boat	1.7360001802444458
i am in your opinion a lara a manfred a lord ruthven then just as i am arriving at the climax you defeat your own end and seek to make an ordinary man of me	1.5620787143707275
their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on albert s account ceased instantly	1.2918294668197632
if he were afterwards to marry mademoiselle <unk> you would accuse me of intrigue and would be challenging me <unk> i may not be there <unk> where at your <unk> why should you not be there because you have not yet invited me. but i come expressly for that <unk> you are very kind but i may be <unk> if i tell you one thing you will be so amiable as to set aside all <unk> tell me what it <unk> my mother begs you to <unk> the comtesse de <unk> said monte cristo starting	2.744028329849243
the young peasant girl at first timid and scared soon recovered herself	1.1889513731002808
the apartment of m. <unk> then became a mousetrap and whoever appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinal s people	1.2688134908676147
a slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed athos of the gascon s uneasiness	1.2120020389556885
i saw him yesterday your friend s lackey was leading <unk> do you think he is worth a hundred <unk> yes	1.2102174758911133
i think it does indeed cried the gascon who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at court	1.210870623588562
one minute that knife one minute a single minute and i will restore it to you through the grating of the door	1.2343056201934814
albert rubbed his eyes ordered his servant to introduce him into the small <unk> on the ground floor dressed himself quickly and went down	1.2919774055480957
i ought not to have driven a bargain when it was to equip a cavalier like <unk> porthos without reply retreated a second step	1.327331781387329
but villefort raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips	1.325438380241394
this is the first time i have gone without my dinner for ten years and it is generally my best <unk> what do you think d <unk> asked athos	1.2610763311386108
well i follow its course i track its passage i adopt the wisdom of the ancients and feel my way for my friendship for your family and my respect for you are as a twofold bandage over my eyes <unk> oh speak speak doctor i shall have <unk> well sir you have in your establishment or in your family perhaps one of the frightful <unk> of which each century produces only one	2.649358034133911
this <unk> possessed another great advantage <unk> of leaving franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of signor <unk> s story in which his mysterious host of monte cristo was so strangely mixed up	1.6498451232910156
oh yes said the count you are looking for the <unk> yes i paid them nothing and yet they are <unk> never mind that maximilian said monte cristo smiling	1.2863932847976685
we will keep on the <unk> for instance and at the first alarm we can leave <unk> and what can we do there <unk> but if they come my brother s carriage will be here <unk> if i should happen to be any distance from you when the carriage comes for <unk> dinner or supper for instance do one <unk> what is that tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together as possible you ask her permission to share my <unk> will she permit it what inconvenience can it be oh delightful	3.1683459281921387

did not you hear fellow yes i <unk> why then did not you reply because these horses are not to be sold was the reply	1.3493698835372925
true enough he wanted to kill me returned the turnkey	1.1203291416168213
in the <unk> one talks politics only with soldiers and jailers and you have not an idea my lord how little is known of what is going on by people of that sort i am of monsieur de <unk> s party	1.6285793781280518
milady remained alone with her eyes fixed upon the door	1.0565130710601807
what is the matter asked albert of franz when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly <unk> i will confess to you albert replied franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand <unk> my dear fellow exclaimed albert what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness	2.1824569702148438
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life	1.2271835803985596
at this signal four soldiers of the <unk> <unk> suddenly appeared and selim fell pierced by five blows	1.275638222694397
my dear bazin said d <unk> i am delighted to see with what wonderful composure you can tell a lie even in church sir replied bazin i have been taught by the good jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good <unk> so far well said aramis we are dying of hunger	2.0856070518493652
oh more than i can say kitty	1.067570686340332
thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition	1.1575953960418701
he turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise when the other made to him a sign of silence	1.2218014001846313
by aramis is meant <unk> which is the name of a demon	1.126482605934143
one would say you were carrying me <unk> and they would be right <unk> oh i think you swore <unk> and the two young girls whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief the one on her own account the other from interest in her friend burst out laughing as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their escape	2.4103782176971436
<unk> he looked at aramis and made a special sign to him with his head	1.137061357498169
the lower rooms were entirely filled with <unk> s troops that is to say with our enemies	1.2039258480072021
if there had been no bolt it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of st. sebastian encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the famous luigi <unk>	1.6478300094604492
because her to lose a hundred thousand francs and that would teach her <unk> i do not understand stammered lucien	1.2264171838760376
he would have been discovered by the beating of his heart if by any <unk> the jailers had entered at that moment	1.2576996088027954
but what are you going to fight about athos asked aramis	1.096868872642517
what is it you edmond back again said he with a broad marseillaise accent and a <unk> that displayed his <unk> teeth	1.342086911201477
i had prepared it beforehand for i am much in want of money <unk> and monte cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand while with the other he held out the receipt to <unk>	1.4643206596374512
is then all that i have heard really true she inquired	1.136229157447815
i doubt not you will consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection but there is a soul of iron in that delicate <unk> body	1.418051838874817
courage cried raoul courage too late murmured the young man too late the water closed above his head and stifled his voice	1.2884769439697266
my father is proud sir and if he had not a meal left i doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone except from <unk> well then after this first visit has been made we shall count on <unk> i must again excuse myself m. morrel for after this first visit has been paid i have another which i am most anxious to <unk> true dantès i forgot that there was at the catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your <unk> lovely <unk> dantès blushed	2.9025113582611084
what is to be done what did the cardinal say about me i was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to <unk> i must then remain here here or in the <unk> you can not take me with you no the order is imperative	2.086402177810669
then an idea came to him which <unk> everything	1.1169109344482422
indeed almost before the door opened the scene changed	1.1054103374481201
oh am i happy enough for that yes you have called haydée your sister <unk> her become so indeed valentine render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me protect her for the count s voice was thick with emotion henceforth she will be alone in the <unk> alone in the world repeated a voice behind the count and why monte cristo turned around haydée was standing pale motionless looking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement	2.65757417678833
he approached the dying man and leaning over him with a calm and melancholy look he whispered i <unk> <unk> and his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to hear it	1.608068585395813
m. d <unk> became very pale he looked round him a second time several members of the club were whispering and getting their arms from under their cloaks	1.3680733442306519
he did not wear the uniform <unk> was not <unk> at that epoch of less liberty but more <unk> a <unk> doublet a little faded and worn and over this a magnificent baldric worked in gold which shone like water <unk> in the sun	1.7293492555618286
be not alarmed at what i say i want to be convinced	1.1338378190994263
the young woman continued to advance and in addition to the lightness of her step which had betrayed her she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet voice	1.4251289367675781
since the bandits had not despatched him at once he felt that they would not kill him at all	1.19185209274292
<unk> understood admirably the war method of that period in which he who could not live at the expense of the enemy must live at the expense of his compatriots	1.4205681085586548
you may go and offer your adieux and mine to madame de <unk>	1.1318484544754028
the countenance of old dantès brightened	1.0855659246444702
i am taken shouted athos with all the power of his lungs	1.1187071800231934
before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned	1.0847859382629395
and knowing that real name my lord replied felton will you sign it all the same doubtless said buckingham and rather twice than <unk> i can not believe continued felton in a voice that became more sharp and rough that your grace knows that it is to milady de winter this <unk> i know it perfectly although i am astonished that you know <unk> and will your grace sign that order without remorse buckingham looked at the young man haughtily	2.6338701248168945
give the lackeys money and they will <unk> we will give them money replied athos	1.156179666519165
at this moment emmanuel entered his countenance full of animation and joy	1.135579228401184
his father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count but i do not think he has much claim to that <unk> why said the banker	1.3609346151351929
there was more especially one upon whom their arrival had produced a decided impression	1.2141743898391724
not to arouse suspicions gentlemen said he go your way and i will go mine and this evening at nine of the clock we will assemble again at the gate saint denis	1.4064892530441284
besides in addition to the pioneers there are four soldiers and a brigadier armed with <unk> that is because they do not see us said athos	1.3127001523971558
i regret i did not inform you sooner of this <unk> you have truly monsieur said d <unk> bowing again a courtesy for which i assure you i am very <unk> you <unk> me replied athos with his gentlemanly air let us talk of something else if you please	1.7119519710540771
this was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting	1.1960651874542236
m. franz is not expected to return home for a year to come i am told in that time many favorable and unforeseen chances may <unk> us	1.3892598152160645
grimaud who held the piece of glass in his hand said <unk> true my lord exclaimed la <unk>	1.1797120571136475
my dear count if you tell me many more marvellous things i warn you i shall not believe <unk> i countenance nothing that is marvellous m. albert	1.3934533596038818
he was quite prepared for any such encounter	1.0971720218658447
at the end of an instant s observation he heard the noise of a vehicle and saw milady s carriage stop opposite to him	1.2518526315689087
two hours later thirty officiating ministers from the most populous and consequently the most disturbed <unk> of paris had assembled there	1.3524775505065918
the poor child was constant in her attendance on her mother and sought by her filial attentions to make her forget the absence of her two sons and her other daughter	1.4533389806747437
no but i know a little about wounds and mine i know is mortal	1.1648370027542114
d <unk> began by making his most splendid toilet then returned to athos s and according to custom related everything to him	1.284738540649414
now monsieur de <unk> piqued himself on his infallible penetration for that which almost proved that he was the son of richelieu was his everlasting pretension he examined attentively the countenance of the <unk> for place and fancied that the contracted eyebrows thin lips hooked nose and prominent <unk> of grimaud were favorable signs	2.183879852294922
she was struck no doubt with a superstitious idea she conceived that heaven denied its aid and she remained in the attitude in which she had fallen her head drooping and her hands clasped	1.4661298990249634
as for andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it	1.745102047920227
at that instant the little <unk> leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened and a tall powerful young man appeared	1.3636409044265747
however the morning of the appointment the young man had established himself in the small salon downstairs	1.205212950706482
this evening said the governor when the task was ended	1.1089242696762085
it was evident that he had attempted to regain his bed but had not had sufficient strength to do so	1.20133376121521
this same waiting maid seems to have an agreeable style said the messenger carelessly	1.245875597000122
did you say he was coming yes summoned by m. de villefort who is apparently as anxious to get mademoiselle valentine married as m. <unk> is to see mademoiselle eugénie settled	1.4328455924987793
but this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature concentrated and insensible by force of <unk>	1.2504539489746094
here was the officer d <unk> was seeking	1.0634653568267822
she howled as the hurricane howled and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature which also seemed to groan with despair	1.3445539474487305
and you did not tell him that you came from me no <unk> at ten of the clock athos with his habitual exactitude was waiting on the pont du louvre and was almost immediately joined by lord de winter	1.4826256036758423
thanks to m. morrel all the forms were got over in a word i was as i told you at my marriage feast and i should have been married in an hour and tomorrow i intended to start for paris had i not been arrested on this charge which you as well as i now see to be <unk> ah said villefort this seems to me the truth	2.056898832321167
at the siege of <unk> i was in the trenches	1.0860718488693237
<unk> returned albert i compliment you on it i have its fellow <unk> took his watch from his waistcoat <unk> and it cost me 3,000 <unk> let us hear the history said franz motioning signor <unk> to seat himself	1.6821805238723755
raoul angry and at the same time uneasy ran after him and seized him by the arm	1.2173138856887817
peter on the contrary of whom the <unk> are the successors continued the jesuit <unk> <unk> the fingers	1.2426462173461914
truly it is i who am mad and you prove to me that passion blinds the most <unk>	1.2511082887649536
i am quite aware that my friend wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as a gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and i have promised to adhere to his instructions	1.7200357913970947
no said albert nor even ancient greek my dear count never had homer or <unk> a more unworthy <unk> than <unk> then said haydée proving by her remark that she had quite understood monte cristo s question and albert s answer then i will speak either in french or italian if my lord so wills <unk> monte cristo reflected one instant	2.1861066818237305
<unk> patrick sign my lord <unk> never help shouted the duke and at the same time he sprang toward his sword	1.2384381294250488
no i shall go incognito count under the name of marie <unk> you are adorable <unk> but do not keep raoul with <unk> why not because he is in <unk> he	1.4299981594085693
now he is gone it is your turn to get out said mme	1.112259030342102
a boat was fastened to the shore by a chain fixed to a stake	1.1908663511276245
the princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon then after dinner the queen was to have a play in her apartment	1.4209930896759033
never mind where it comes from said porthos let us taste it and if it is good let us drink <unk> no said athos do not let us drink wine which comes from an unknown <unk> you are right athos said d <unk>	1.5164880752563477
he the support the liberator the father of the people	1.1344196796417236
those gilded <unk> drawers locked like gates of <unk> <unk> of <unk> come from i know not where and the <unk> of letters from england holland spain india china and peru have generally a strange influence on a father s mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents	2.5391170978546143
he is doubtless come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague	1.1513466835021973
but then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure without arms to defend himself	1.2429784536361694
he wished to have the young man at <unk> that he at all mistrusted him but for the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the queen	1.3646817207336426
but fernand was mistaken a man of his disposition never kills himself for he constantly hopes	1.2454640865325928
then do your best to keep our name free from dishonor	1.1476105451583862
m. morrel unhappy exclaimed the abbé	1.074831485748291
benedetto never again appeared at <unk> neither have i since that day either seen or heard anything concerning him	1.3392887115478516
they are fed on <unk> only your <unk> and how do you like my wine asked porthos it is pleasant is not it capital it is nothing however but a wine of the <unk> really yes a small declivity to the south yonder on my hill gives me twenty <unk> quite a vineyard hey porthos sighed for the fifth <unk> <unk> had counted his sighs	2.307704448699951
i have been waiting for a long time to tell him what i think of him	1.1095134019851685
speak speak said valentine i entreat <unk> has your resolution changed valentine it can not change unhappy man you know it must not cried the young girl	1.3642317056655884
this obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy when they could but lament the absence of dantès whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially	1.6037951707839966
for one second d <unk> thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and d <unk> recognized the coadjutor	1.603361964225769
then i should like to have three sons i should make the first a nobleman like athos the second a good soldier like porthos the third an excellent abbé like aramis	1.4103142023086548
are you sure you are more reasonable yes said valentine and i have but one scruple <unk> of leaving my dear grandmother s remains which i had undertaken to <unk> valentine said morrel death is in itself <unk> yes said valentine besides it will not be for long. she then crossed the corridor and led the way down a narrow staircase to m. <unk> s room morrel followed her on tiptoe at the door they found the old servant	2.5412187576293945
you know well that i do not like to leave things half <unk> conclude then sir answered de chatillon with as much hauteur as aramis	1.3798147439956665
he remembered that <unk> had been taxed at 4,000 crowns and as he considered himself of much greater importance than <unk> he fixed his own price at 8,000 crowns	1.4592479467391968
tomorrow at the hôtel field of the cloth of gold a lackey in black and red will wait for your <unk> oh said d <unk> this is rather warm it appears that milady and i are anxious about the health of the same person	1.6148351430892944
by reading or using any part of this project <unk> electronic work you indicate that you have read understand agree to and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property <unk> agreement	1.430129051208496
planchet addressed the officer with a fine flemish phrase the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all and the bargain was concluded madeleine s brother entered d <unk> s service	1.5791010856628418
he addressed about twelve words to him grimaud answered in four	1.1386082172393799
there could be no doubt she owed this information to the cardinal	1.108947992324829
the repast was magnificent monte cristo had endeavored completely to overturn the parisian ideas and to feed the curiosity as much as the appetite of his guests	1.407119870185852
it was of this detachment sent as a vanguard that our friend d <unk> formed a part	1.2186170816421509
his situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one	1.2280789613723755
<unk> asked for a knife and fork	1.0787396430969238
faith you are indeed right not to return to it	1.1284905672073364
then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity	1.2747817039489746
thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take away with them a sum of money which if not large was sufficient as a provision against delays and accidents	1.5481739044189453
be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a semblance of probability and communicate the fact to me by a line in writing	1.425047755241394
is this carriage for me said dantès	1.0578651428222656
albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mother s bed	1.1498602628707886
the marechal de grammont and the comte de guiche had returned to paris and he was quite lonely	1.1406254768371582
he cast his eyes around and saw the horn full of powder which his friend jacopo had left him	1.2334105968475342
yes said he yes that would flatter me very much but i should not have time enough to enjoy the distinction	1.2752784490585327
in fact it seems to me so great an honor for a prisoner that i think monsieur de comminges must be <unk> what	1.263956069946289
<unk> i do not know he is no longer in my hands replied villefort	1.0832860469818115
i would confide my life to them but i should hesitate ere i trusted them with your majesty s. well said athos since you have not a regiment we are three devoted men	1.4614979028701782
the two arms fell with a sudden force they heard the <unk> of the scimitar and the cry of the victim then a <unk> mass sank beneath the blow	1.3784857988357544
help me out of paris help me out of france i can not take you however to the siege of la rochelle said d <unk>	1.2327061891555786
then have a care i repeat for you seek to persuade me and if you succeed i should lose my reason for i should hope that i could again behold <unk> the count smiled	1.4312472343444824
and you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a <unk> yes monsieur and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a line	1.4434362649917603
grimaud had indeed during twenty-two years of service seen his master extricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than athos s imminent death was likely to make him uneasy	1.517311453819275
the young officer however remained mute and motionless his look alone had spoken	1.1733391284942627
thou <unk> simpleton said d <unk> to his servant that they wished no harm to <unk> but to whom then i faith	1.264506459236145
but a recompense was in store for him turning around he saw near the door a beautiful fair face whose large blue eyes were without any marked expression fixed upon him while the bouquet of <unk> was gently raised to her lips	1.6543399095535278
thus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and who are perhaps the because of it but wait wait	1.3084062337875366
it was however necessary to affect weakness and <unk> a very difficult task for so finished an actress as milady	1.2939984798431396
buckingham tried to smile a last time but death checked his thought which remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of love	1.3819173574447632
from time to time <unk> darted on his wife keen searching glances but rapid as the lightning flash	1.3170833587646484

it would be impossible to describe <unk> s astonishment when from the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching followed by a sergeant with a dozen men	1.3308147192001343

the return d <unk> was astounded by the terrible confidence of athos yet many things appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation	1.3688358068466187
it had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength	1.2260115146636963

the <unk> was magnificent not only was the villa brilliantly illuminated but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended from the trees in the garden and very soon the palace overflowed to the terraces and the terraces to the <unk>	1.6770340204238892
but as to what had been done by porthos and d <unk> afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the chateau	1.2643636465072632
her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so for were it once discovered by her father and mother all would be lost	1.6321288347244263
i have the power of so doing said monte cristo	1.0804461240768433
it turned out as d <unk> had foreseen	1.0697267055511475
he saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a <unk> star to appear before him was the vast <unk> of waters sombre and terrible whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm	2.0424158573150635

this succor which came to porthos at the moment in which he was attacked in his <unk> hopes inspired much gratitude in the musketeer toward the procurator s wife	1.383011817932129
as soon as she was seated in the vehicle she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil which she tied on to her straw bonnet	1.3535374402999878

pooh said the duke too much astonished to believe it true	1.1151329278945923
creating the works from print editions not protected by <unk>	1.1283396482467651
then after seeing her eyes closed and hearing her breathe gently he believed she had dropped asleep and left the apartment on tiptoe closing the door after him with the utmost precaution	1.4553911685943604
at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and <unk> saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome	1.586877465248108
it was the fever that disturbed you madame said villefort	1.1101446151733398
the opinion of all the commercial men was that under the reverses which had successively weighed down morrel it was impossible for him to remain solvent	1.4361565113067627
the conversation took a cheerful turn	1.070949912071228
you will find mine on my saddle already <unk> <unk> breathed a sigh he could not understand visits of ceremony made under arms	1.3625476360321045
in the struggle her clothes caught fire and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate	1.3682355880737305
hold my stirrup bazin cried aramis and aramis sprang into the saddle with his usual grace and agility but after a few <unk> and <unk> of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so <unk> that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat	1.8193516731262207
if <unk> knew where his wife was one might by extreme means force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret escape	1.3675386905670166
marseilles is filled with <unk> officers who are daily under one frivolous pretext or other getting up quarrels with the royalists from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of persons and <unk> in the <unk> you have heard perhaps said the comte de <unk> one of m. de <unk> s oldest friends and chamberlain to the comte d artois that the holy alliance purpose removing him from thence yes they were talking about it when we left paris said m. de <unk> and where is it decided to transfer him to saint <unk> for heaven s sake where is that asked the marquise	4.178928852081299
as to the rest of the blade the master had slyly put that on one side to make himself a <unk> pin	1.2941420078277588
i trust your majesty will pardon this intrusion on her meditations but a foreign lord has arrived from england and waits in the parlor demanding the honor of presenting a letter to your <unk> oh a letter	1.5618414878845215
and what have i done dear <unk> that you should be angry with me cried valentine	1.16851806640625
pale with a dull eye and heavy heart all the noble features of that face usually so calm and serene were <unk> by grief	1.3795623779296875
morrel pulled the bell but though he nearly broke the cord no one answered	1.2080628871917725
i was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of namely that four years afterwards this colossus of power would be overthrown	1.4813392162322998
i wished to run to the window and call for help but my legs refused their office	1.205696702003479
at last d <unk> thought it was time to try one of his favorite <unk> in fencing	1.2006844282150269
if he closed his eyes he saw cardinal spada s letter written on the wall in characters of <unk> he slept for a moment the <unk> dreams haunted his brain	1.4404642581939697
yet i had read i had even written a precise history of the borgia family for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the cardinal cæsar spada but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the cardinal rospigliosi his companion in misfortune	2.0434744358062744
moreover its port was the last in the kingdom of france open to the english and by closing it against england our eternal enemy the cardinal completed the work of <unk> of <unk> and the duc de guise	1.6040942668914795
he immediately ran in the direction of portsmouth which he saw at nearly half a league before him standing out in the <unk> of the morning with its houses and towers	1.4254534244537354
the pompous procession therefore wended its way towards père-lachaise from the faubourg saint-honoré	1.217732548713684
twice he was obliged to step back his opponent stirred not one inch	1.228098750114441

we were in the palace of yanina she snatched me from the cushions on which i was sleeping and on opening my eyes i saw hers filled with tears	1.3873540163040161
at the sight of these men the englishman started and advanced a step then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment	1.3734735250473022
we will not <unk> you to help us we <unk> no one against his conscience but we will compel you to act generously even if you are not disposed to do so. you would call acting generously knowing your conspiracy and not informing against you that is what i should call becoming your accomplice	2.056090831756592

the two ladies entered the drawing-room with that sort of official stiffness which <unk> a formal communication	1.2643693685531616
comminges had arrested one of the <unk> and had ordered him to be hanged near the cross of du <unk> but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were attacked in the market-place with stones and halberds the <unk> had escaped to the rue des lombards and rushed into a house	1.8313769102096558

madame de villefort however reassured by the silence which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of valentine again extended her hand and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass	1.5539512634277344
it was nothing but a plan of attack against the cardinal	1.0950615406036377
ah <unk> is that you said porthos to d <unk>	1.0751093626022339
he shook his head perceived the cabaret at which he had left aramis and putting his horse to the trot he shortly pulled up at the door	1.3283255100250244
the conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that <unk> did not seek to <unk> him and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion	1.431259274482727
no more theses no more <unk> upon the fingers or upon benedictions hey aramis smiled	1.2714489698410034

then my brother determined to substitute cunning for force	1.1537789106369019
i have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans	1.1300338506698608

from the time d <unk> took quarters in that hotel the mistress of the house a pretty and fresh looking flemish woman twenty-five or twenty-six years old had been singularly interested in him and after certain love passages much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to whom a dozen times d <unk> had made a pretence of passing a sword through his body that husband had disappeared one fine morning after furtively selling certain choice lots of wine carrying away with him money and jewels	3.5750885009765625
having poured out the soup the turnkey retired	1.1242092847824097

i see him the brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole and had discovered andrea in a posture of entreaty	1.2868306636810303

he seemed to be quite overcome	1.037668228149414
it was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the shore	1.2347079515457153

d <unk> returned to less important affairs and the three musketeers repaired to the king s quarters where they had to prepare their lodging	1.2797703742980957
in the most simple and natural manner possible	1.088096261024475
then you were about to tell me <unk> isolation of your life the griefs of your heart	1.173266887664795

what do you mean to say i mean to say that i have a good reason but that it is difficult to <unk> you must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline <unk> yourself with my <unk> no sir said <unk> i merely suspend my decision that is <unk> and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had never been <unk> the count bit his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the <unk> of anger which his proud and <unk> temper scarcely allowed him to restrain understanding however that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his steps and again confronted the banker	10.004450798034668

nevertheless rapid as the movement had been d <unk> had had time to get a glimpse of the head of an old man	1.2541844844818115

but make <unk> can not stay here all <unk> other footsteps going and coming were now heard and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dantès ears the bed creaked and the heavy <unk> of a man who <unk> a weight sounded on the floor then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it	2.231755495071411
in that case replied the abbé he should be a man blessed of god rich <unk> <unk> smiled bitterly	1.2266377210617065

from his windows he saw all the visitors who were caught	1.1339493989944458
at this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned away	1.1731386184692383

he hit him but once but as he had foretold that hit was a mortal one the sword pierced his heart	1.3204035758972168

he had always something or other to do	1.08855402469635
lord de winter arrived at the appointed time but athos being warned of his coming went into the other chamber	1.2449710369110107
buckingham remained nearly a year absent	1.1173924207687378
there let us dine then said porthos it is getting <unk> the friends at ease with regard to the future did honor to the repast the remains of which were abandoned to <unk> bazin planchet and grimaud	1.5421916246414185
edmond listened and the sound became more and more distinct	1.133176565170288
do you mean is he a good comrade	1.0844680070877075
and she fell on her knees at the same time holding me up towards heaven as if she desired while praying to god in my behalf to raise me actually to his <unk> and for the second time haydée stopped overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance so parched and dry were her throat and lips	2.4979732036590576
raoul remained silent for he was not prepared for the dignity of the <unk> esprit	1.1754039525985718
no no i am here said the monk quickly coming back to him	1.137212872505188
however i have turned the business over to <unk> so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you for my own part i care nothing about the count or his mysterious <unk> <unk> i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth <unk> francs wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5,000 francs <unk> he seems to have a mania for diamonds said <unk> smiling and i <unk> believe that like <unk> he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of strewing them along the road as tom thumb did his <unk> <unk> perhaps he has discovered some mine said madame <unk>	4.502195358276367
yes my lord my mother replied the young man advancing into the room until he was face to face with lord de winter and crossing his arms	1.2836562395095825
he will do anything i wish	1.055957317352295
i was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror and without a word i suffered myself to be <unk> and tied to a horse s tail and thus they took me to nîmes	1.4686440229415894
<unk> what is it it is the uniform of the cardinal s guards	1.0773138999938965
you are no longer in my service monsieur <unk> oh your excellency your excellency cried the steward struck with terror at this threat if that is the only reason i can not remain in your service i will tell all for if i quit you it will only be to go to the <unk> that is different replied monte cristo but if you intend to tell an untruth reflect it were better not to speak at <unk> no monsieur i swear to you by my hopes of salvation i will tell you all for the abbé busoni himself only knew a part of my secret but i pray you go away from that <unk>	3.311514377593994
you will be able to indulge all your fancies besides should you find your income insufficient you can for the sake of the past madame make use of mine and i am ready to offer you all i possess on <unk> thank you <unk> you replied the baroness you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires who intends for some time at least to retire from the <unk> debray was for a moment surprised but immediately recovering himself he bowed with an air which seemed to say as you please <unk> madame <unk> had until then perhaps hoped for something but when she saw the careless bow of debray and the glance by which it was accompanied together with his significant silence she raised her head and without passion or violence or even hesitation ran downstairs <unk> to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her	7.055802822113037
what the devil continued the king	1.0464502573013306
that gentleman your friend defended himself desperately	1.1117230653762817
i have four <unk> which are considered the <unk> in the <unk> and a pack of hounds which are <unk> for twenty leagues <unk> and porthos heaved another sigh	1.3849480152130127
d <unk> is too good a comrade to leave his brothers in embarrassment while he wears the ransom of a king on his <unk> chapter xxix	1.3770477771759033
here laporte said buckingham these are the only tokens i ever received from <unk> silver casket and these two letters	1.3215547800064087
tomorrow said he you will be avenged or i shall be <unk> no said she you will avenge me but you will not be dead	1.2251672744750977
at this moment the clock struck eleven	1.0522243976593018
let us see for you know my dear captain a judge must hear both <unk> good lord	1.2160437107086182
this <unk> of drunkenness had something frightful in it	1.1248712539672852
well said she hardly giving franz time to sit down it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new lord ruthven and you are already the best friends in the <unk> without being so far advanced as that my dear countess returned franz i can not deny that we have abused his good nature all <unk> all day yes this morning we breakfasted with him we rode in his carriage all day and now we have taken possession of his <unk> you know him then yes and no. how so it is a long <unk> tell it to me. it would frighten you too <unk> so much the more <unk> at least wait until the story has a <unk> very well i prefer complete <unk> but tell me how you made his acquaintance	5.106308460235596
i have drawn nine hundred thousand francs you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs	1.2037098407745361
perhaps i may one day put on my best coat and presenting myself at the great gate introduce myself	1.2771044969558716
what can he want with me he wishes to speak to <unk> to me <unk> did he mention my name <unk> what sort of person is he why sir a man of about <unk> short or tall about your own height <unk> dark or fair dark <unk> dark with black eyes black hair black <unk> and how dressed asked villefort quickly	2.1720871925354004
everyone therefore ran to the court some to witness the sight others to comment upon it	1.2553684711456299
<unk> uttered a little cry and fled	1.073091745376587
this was a terrible moment for the fugitives	1.088546872138977
what does your worship want demanded the host pale and trembling from the discovery he had just made	1.274448275566101
it is well madame said mazarin nothing can <unk> such <unk> sir replied the queen closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it if there is anything to be said it is that i have always been ungrateful to the brave men who saved <unk> i have given nothing to that gallant officer d <unk> you were speaking of just now but my hand to kiss and this <unk> as she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger	2.7771308422088623
i wish to see <unk> if your majesty wishes to look <unk> then look replied d <unk>	1.1462305784225464
the men themselves were almost dead with fatigue but hope supported them	1.1745305061340332
instantly afterwards four carbineers on horseback appeared on the edge of the wood three of them appeared to be looking for the fugitive while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner by the neck	1.5380512475967407
i say that he has hastily accused your majesty s musketeers toward whom he is unjust and that he has not obtained his information from good <unk> the accusation comes from monsieur de la <unk> from the duke himself	1.5071882009506226
rather place faith in what i tell you	1.1167439222335815
he made a sign which i understood but the king s guards must have noticed it and held themselves on guard	1.21188223361969
it was at the <unk> that had left in the morning and the tartan that had just set sail that edmond fixed his eyes	1.243173360824585
beauty has always been and always will be all-powerful	1.1270719766616821
perhaps god will pardon you but i never for pity s sake said the executioner extending his arms	1.2218127250671387
he must know where his master is without a doubt he <unk> d <unk> thought for a moment then took his sword and put on his cloak to go out	1.305661678314209
did you come here to fetch me	1.0684425830841064
he however kept a good countenance holding his hat in his hand and awaiting the good pleasure of his eminence without too much assurance but also without too much humility	1.4035643339157104
then he explained to him the because of his visit and the service he required of him	1.1811654567718506
i thought you were at <unk> i was but am now back <unk> and where is the dear boy our little edmond why with his father no doubt replied <unk>	1.4112616777420044
<unk> with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable	1.1315231323242188
he has i repeat the longest head of the four and for my part i declare that i will obey him	1.2500331401824951
<unk> continued his way and went as far as the tour de <unk>	1.1442842483520508
i am the queen do you recognize me no madame replied d <unk>	1.0888599157333374
i waited a month or rather i suffered for a month	1.131351113319397
i hope you will not complain now said the jeweller	1.0917805433273315
there said he demand thy child of carlini he will tell thee what has become of her and he returned to his companions	1.2894665002822876
on their arrival at the castle they learned that buckingham and the king were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away	1.3034785985946655
athos with his superior understanding wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion and at the moment when his friends in deference to his <unk> and sobriety dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and <unk> freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the <unk>	3.72930908203125
the stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous <unk> of the guides	1.4343547821044922
this time it was a great matter that was under discussion connected with a vessel laden with turkey carpets stuffs of the levant and <unk>	1.3893747329711914
the count placed himself between <unk> and the window thus cutting off from the thief his only chance of retreat	1.2729074954986572
four years ago <unk> was at <unk> count is the old sailor you saw in the garden and who from quartermaster has become <unk> when he was at trieste saw on the quay an englishman who was on the point of embarking on board a yacht and he recognized him as the person who called on my father the fifth of june 1829 and who wrote me this letter on the fifth of september	2.394019842147827
the fourth and last side of your cell faces <unk> <unk> a minute now where does it face the wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole by which light was admitted to the chamber	1.6359788179397583
both were men of courage and honor and as m. de la <unk> protestant and seeing the king <unk> of no party he did not in general carry any bias into his social relations	1.5658454895019531
the idea of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind and with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings before	1.3246136903762817
unquestionably edmond s star is in the <unk> and he will marry the splendid <unk> will be captain too and laugh at us all unless <unk> sinister smile passed over <unk> <unk> unless i take a hand in the affair he added	1.725672721862793
faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt	1.1511876583099365
the two combatants had been seen in a position which left no doubt of their intentions	1.1821951866149902
one of them lifted the plank took out a flask of wine drank some and then passed it to his companion	1.2913599014282227
ho exclaimed d <unk> picking up a louis and displaying it here is a louis that <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> blushed so <unk> that the gascon began to laugh at him and said porthos would be angry my dear monsieur <unk> but i pardon you only let us remember that this gold must serve us as a joke so be <unk> <unk> <unk> instantly assumed a jovial countenance saddled the horses quickly and mounted his own without making faces over it	2.842740535736084
it might be a vengeance of milady that was most probable	1.1175819635391235
if d <unk> forgets his host or appears to forget him under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried we will not forget him and we know where he is	1.457704782485962
i will not attempt to argue with you but i blame <unk> heyday cried d <unk> what matters it to me after all if cromwell who is an englishman revolts against his king who is a <unk>	1.5749691724777222
there is neither happiness nor misery in the world there is only the comparison of one state with another nothing more	1.2931175231933594
grimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the donjon of vincennes	1.191981554031372
do not question me i beg of you but lend me a <unk> my stables are at your command viscount but you will kill yourself by riding on horseback	1.4245944023132324
if you could but persuade him to come out monsieur i should owe you the gratitude of my whole life i should adore you as my patron saint then he is there	1.4674863815307617
our swords cried d <unk> raising his head and regaining his <unk>	1.109423041343689
then m. de <unk> made a sign with his hand and all retired except d <unk> who did not forget that he had an audience and with the tenacity of a gascon remained in his place	1.4087506532669067
you see it is yourself who have first named <unk> her <unk> have pity on valentine	1.2185343503952026
however proud you may be you will not refuse to accept one of them and to request your three companions to accept the <unk> is in order to make war against us	1.3927141427993774
but come what is this about asked porthos	1.0811833143234253
though answered in the negative he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor that in despite of the <unk> assurance of the <unk> that they were occupied dantès succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them	2.0088632106781006
still it belongs to government and i ought not to waste it but having received the signal that i might rest for an hour here he glanced at the <unk> for there was everything in the enclosure of montlhéry even a <unk> and having ten minutes before me and my strawberries being ripe when a day <unk> sir do you think dormice eat them indeed i should think not replied monte cristo dormice are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved as the romans <unk> what	3.1755712032318115
you owe me nothing but some trifle of 20,000 francs which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses so that there is not much of a score between us <unk> you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might <unk> upon my word said albert i deserve no credit for what i could not help namely a determination to take everything as i found it and to let those bandits see that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of <unk> death himself	5.4744181632995605
it was the letter written as our readers know to julie and signed sinbad the <unk> unknown you say is the man who rendered you this <unk> to you yes we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand continued maximilian	1.6862744092941284
this creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from observation	1.4779548645019531
and on this assurance the four friends who had finished their modest repast separated with the promise of meeting again that evening	1.3104774951934814
yes my lord and from pure devotion to the because for monsieur de <unk> is <unk> rich said mazarin whom that single word always inspired with a great respect	1.3712615966796875
early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret <unk>	1.530538558959961
the storm increased the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly the thunder began to growl and the wind the <unk> of a hurricane whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen	1.546195387840271
of this treaty at least i have been warned	1.096770167350769
then you must suffer <unk> suffer hunger said <unk> becoming pale	1.144567847251892
tomorrow then he added turning towards <unk>	1.0769940614700317
few have passed through this revolutionary period in the midst of which we were born without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier or the gown of the magistrate	1.584725260734558
ali knows i generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee he has heard that i ordered tea and he also knows that i brought you home with me when i summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking he naturally <unk> that we shall smoke in company and therefore brings two <unk> instead of <unk> now the mystery is <unk> certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that <unk> but what do i hear and <unk> inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a <unk>	5.718646049499512
she would have questioned him as he passed by her but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed oh mademoiselle mademoiselle what a dreadful misfortune	1.5837087631225586
you were not certain my child was dead and you buried it	1.1294633150100708
dragoons swiss guardsmen musketeers <unk> succeeded one another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host very well but agreed badly with the views of the four friends	1.5522884130477905
not at all my young man	1.0521222352981567
yes in italy it was in italy most probably replied monte cristo you have travelled then in italy mademoiselle yes madame and i were there two years ago	1.3541494607925415
the cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice and the king was very pale	1.0969352722167969
the devil take this gout athos and aramis took their leave but even in the <unk> they could still hear the duke s cries he was evidently suffering the tortures of the damned	1.4888877868652344
no but franz has for heaven s sake not a word of this before him	1.1664118766784668
the explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do	1.1547441482543945
i hope so. the friends embraced cordially d <unk> pressed raoul s hand	1.1733512878417969
valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples round her eyes and down her cheeks	1.2883257865905762
this portion of the napkin was marked with half a baron s crown and the letter <unk> truly truly said madame <unk> all my linen is marked thus monsieur de <unk> was a baron and my name is hermine	1.6022467613220215
i hate him so little that i should be delighted to order masses for the repose of his <unk> you are not called <unk> for nothing observed madame de chevreuse your teeth are <unk> you are unjust to a great poet it seems to me raoul ventured to say	1.7617242336273193
what was passing in that brain so loaded with dreadful secrets	1.1725965738296509
as the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong	1.2295817136764526
do you speak spanish grammont faith my lord but <unk> and i not at all said the prince laughing	1.217130184173584
and you porthos do you only wear such a fine golden baldric to suspend a sword of straw from it	1.279666543006897
it is true the cardinal had been particularly <unk>	1.0657557249069214
ah said d <unk> i did not see that it was the sword of the comte de <unk> which made that hole when he gave me a good thrust in the <unk> you are wounded asked buckingham as he opened the letter	1.4504153728485107
porthos was seduced by a <unk> doublet and <unk> breeches	1.1283360719680786
he put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes that he might not witness the <unk> of his faithful friends	1.3565723896026611
listen to the voice of your heart morrel and ask it whether you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards me. my friend said maximilian the voice of my heart is very sorrowful and promises me nothing but <unk> it is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black cloud	1.8456265926361084
it was evident that she was making unnatural efforts to subdue her anger she <unk> herself <unk> at her <unk> and walked up and down	1.3207671642303467
unluckily i hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with <unk> and he said nothing as he died yes he exclaimed oh i suppose answered d <unk> laughing if he only said that it did not enlighten you <unk> well sir cried the queen	1.7161345481872559
i am only curious to unravel the mystery to which she is attached	1.1604593992233276
did not you see that monsieur d <unk> mounted with difficulty	1.1055412292480469
i told her of the scaffold oh heavens i forgot that it awaits me also	1.1857550144195557
and madame de villefort cried <unk>	1.0448954105377197
the dead man and the two wounded were carried off by their comrades and i have heard nothing of either of them since	1.2701786756515503
no it is not finished i feel it by what remains in my heart	1.1658014059066772
ah replied he sighing that is not very surprising i have been more than a year absent from paris and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut the count takes me for a provincial	1.5147489309310913
science becomes in their hands not only a defensive weapon but still more frequently an offensive one the one serves against all their physical sufferings the other against all their enemies	1.5745173692703247
it seems his former master accustomed him to <unk> well dear monsieur la <unk> replied the cardinal let him prove a true and thankful keeper and we will shut our eyes upon his rural <unk> and put on his back a uniform to make him respectable and in the pockets of that uniform some <unk> to drink to the king s <unk> mazarin was large in promises <unk> unlike the virtuous monsieur grimaud so <unk> by la <unk> for he said nothing and did much	2.963359832763672
the servants had just disappeared under the trees followed by the tutor and the young men were laughing and talking about a hundred yards off	1.2620410919189453
let me meditate and <unk> meditate and consider as much as you like replied porthos who was now quite out of humor at seeing things take this turn	1.4763063192367554
say to him that when he is alone it will help us if he will knock on the floor for then i can continue my work in safety	1.3630523681640625
the same impression was experienced by all present and no one was deceived by the expression of his countenance	1.1925075054168701
he was at the moment conversing cheerfully with morrel but he was well prepared for what might happen	1.2213088274002075
hold yourself ready then to join me at the champs-élysées and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my <unk> maximilian hung his head and obeyed with childlike reverence	1.4851948022842407
i have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire monsieur d <unk> and myself to do in your service	1.1938660144805908
he <unk> replied that the death was not a natural one and must be attributed to what to <unk> indeed said monte cristo with a slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush or his pallor or the intense interest with which he listened indeed maximilian did you hear that yes my dear count i heard it and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to <unk> monte cristo listened or appeared to do so with the greatest calmness	3.1093409061431885
i must have left it in my room she said	1.0766366720199585
he could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars or refuse food and die of starvation	1.2523651123046875
yet through a singular impulse it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied but to emmanuel	1.2877650260925293
yes <unk> i die well valentine resumed maximilian i can only say again that you are right	1.2200678586959839
oh you are an angel exclaimed the young man	1.0515499114990234
you will allow me to leave first then after half an hour you can go away in your <unk> yes monseigneur	1.2062385082244873
it lasted nearly three hours he then heard a noise of something falling and all was silent	1.219559907913208
the cardinal there awaited louis xiii	1.069040298461914
was that all he said inquired athos	1.0876349210739136
far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen all <unk> to their utmost height to try and see	1.3645628690719604
then let us sit down said villefort impatiently for it will take some <unk> sit down said the old man	1.1648813486099243
during the ligue about which <unk> was speaking just now the people chanted nothing except the mass so everything went to destruction	1.4051223993301392
her hands clutched her armchair she ground her teeth <unk> her eyes followed the motion of the door as it closed behind lord de winter and felton and the moment she was alone a fresh fit of despair seized her	1.5905132293701172
he lodges at the hôtel des princes	1.0683313608169556
on beholding this house d <unk> calm as he was in general felt an unusual disturbance within his <unk> powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of youth	1.5441139936447144
<unk> tried to walk made two steps and sank upon her knees	1.1350212097167969
ah this is not right athos insults us he wishes to die alone it is bad bad <unk> <unk> witnessing this despair melted into tears in a corner of the room	1.4881768226623535
there was an impressive silence <unk> alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an <unk> who was not always listened to with so much complacency	1.4133758544921875

astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed she advanced towards valentine and for the first time noticed the white lips	1.4896633625030518
the assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without having killed their man they should be accused by him therefore their first idea was to join the enemy	1.4689913988113403
to take <unk> athos curled his lip with disdain	1.1187735795974731
