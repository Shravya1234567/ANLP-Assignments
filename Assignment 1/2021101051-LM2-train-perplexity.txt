a cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was as sportsmen would say keeping his hand in	90.78814697265625
oh yes i assure you count they want nothing that can render them happy they are young and cheerful they are tenderly attached to each other and with twenty-five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as <unk> <unk> thousand francs is not a large sum however replied monte cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to maximilian s heart like the voice of a father but they will not be content with that	64.95988464355469
i am so <unk> i have known a man much more unfortunate than you <unk> impossible alas said monte cristo it is the infirmity of our nature always to believe ourselves much more unhappy than those who groan by our sides what can be more wretched than the man who has lost all he loved and desired in the world listen morrel and pay attention to what i am about to tell you	69.58138275146484
raoul motioned to the host to approach threw a crown upon the table mounted his horse and posted his letter at senlis	77.95654296875
well do not you intend to bring me another plate said dant√®s	55.17018508911133
it was her husband who had discovered the disappearance of the moneybag and was crying thieves oh my god cried mme	50.060237884521484
d <unk> seeing him approach drew his sword a foot out of the scabbard	35.26906204223633
the cavalier entered the second hall which was guarded by the musketeers and doorkeepers	37.782676696777344
has anything particular happened in the neighborhood	124.89974212646484
have you forgotten my lord that it is he who answered for me to the queen since then monsieur de beaufort has become an enemy of the <unk> that may be my lord but since i am neither king nor queen nor minister he is not my enemy and i can not accept your <unk> this then is what you call devotion	54.96298599243164
in which the plot thickens his visit to m. de <unk> being paid the pensive d <unk> took the longest way homeward	55.274147033691406
at this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near and a bright light flashed over the room	35.74877166748047
is this that <unk> asked he after a moment of silence	42.98772430419922
then he drew from his <unk> the little emerald box raised the golden lid and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea which he placed in her hand	39.116065979003906
come you are accounted for you are here but where are your friends i do not know my lord	32.64080810546875

the men he beheld saw him undoubtedly for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind	111.54499053955078
you have heard what i said	39.43893814086914
then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the <unk> all was over	53.95159149169922
this news false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred evidently astonished the auditors and they retired without a word	124.71328735351562
revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her head	64.79944610595703
then he determined to go up	62.4905891418457
he waited then in the <unk> with impatience till he should be conducted to them	76.21796417236328
but can they will they receive an unhappy king who will bring such a sad story into a country already agitated by civil discord	188.71180725097656
when i returned she was married	93.82962036132812
he then laid him down on the floor where d <unk> after giving him just time enough to draw his breath gagged him with his long scarf and the moment he had done so began to undress him with the <unk> and dexterity of a man who had learned his business on the field of battle	42.880577087402344
mazarin replied d <unk> bursting into a laugh	45.79363250732422
this gentleman asks me for information which common politeness will not permit me to <unk> politeness you simpleton retorted la <unk>	70.29319763183594

last february you were the first who told me of the haitian funds	67.6544189453125
pardon me and then tell me how i can risk my life to serve your grace you are a brave young man said buckingham holding out his hand to d <unk> who pressed it respectfully	32.2947998046875
you see my strength fails me you see plainly i can not walk	70.52526092529297
you have received a regular letter of advice yes said <unk> but i confess i did not quite comprehend its <unk> indeed and for that reason i did myself the honor of calling upon you in order to beg for an <unk> go on monsieur	58.989036560058594
those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy him as a slave	68.56039428710938
so much the worse so much the <unk> as they say in my <unk> reverend sir i am <unk> every criminal says the same <unk> <unk> pshaw said busoni disdainfully poverty may make a man beg steal a loaf of bread at a baker s door but not because him to open a <unk> in a house supposed to be inhabited	90.62071228027344

but apropos of debray how is it that i have not seen him lately at the baron s house there has been a <unk> what with the baroness no with the <unk> has he perceived anything ah that is a good joke do you think he suspects said monte cristo with charming artlessness	52.268165588378906
<unk> when this man is satisfied let him be <unk> <unk> remained prostrate while the count withdrew when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow before which the bandits bowed	82.77722930908203
after a second a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air and then franz heard a slight report	55.80657196044922
in which it is proved that first impulses are oftentimes the best	59.99856948852539
may i beg of you baroness to honor me with an introduction to your daughter oh you are no <unk> least not by name replied madame <unk> and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but you	85.82653045654297
for you and your <unk> this greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even porthos and this french generosity repeated by lord de winter and his friend was highly applauded except by mm	123.5551528930664
sire murmured lord leven crushed by shame sire we are ready to give you every proof of our <unk> i ask but one said the king put the army in battle array and face the <unk> that can not be sire said the earl	75.66641998291016
the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or <unk> of at certain conventional moments the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation or rouse themselves from their musings to listen to some brilliant effort of <unk> s a well-executed recitative by <unk> or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of la <unk> but that momentary excitement over they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation	143.1519012451172
the first rendezvous was fixed for the following wednesday at eight of the clock in the evening precisely	21.834095001220703
his face a little elongated had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish excitement	140.09861755371094
now my lord give me if you have not lost it the <unk> which contained the <unk> the duke took it from under his pillow and gave it to grimaud	38.93443298339844
come speak said the latter closing the door and bolting it that they might not be disturbed	42.481178283691406
you at least will be faithful to me <unk> the horse as if it understood these words bent its red nostrils toward the king s face and parting his lips displayed all its teeth as if with pleasure	91.83370971679688
if we had you my friends	66.732666015625
at the door he met the commissary of police who was waiting for him	15.003119468688965
as nine of the clock sounded d <unk> was at the place royale	20.719776153564453
in the space of half an hour we shall know the emperor s answer	39.667755126953125
i am frightful tonight she said	63.4490966796875
all this is very strange and i am curious to know how it will <unk> badly monsieur badly replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of planchet for <unk> aloud as very preoccupied people do he had entered the alley at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber	66.64423370361328
you should recognize him among a thousand say you continued he	208.27218627929688
my husband could accompany me. but do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor you have ample proof to the contrary if you look opposite said the baroness as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful greek	102.64805603027344
it was scarcely eleven of the clock in the morning and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with m. de <unk> who could not fail to think the manner in which d <unk> had left him a little cavalier	25.29961585998535
let us sit down to supper	27.846601486206055
what you ask is impossible monsieur continued he addressing faria	115.95370483398438
my father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king the cardinal and <unk> he considered the first three personages in <unk> d <unk> added m. de <unk> to the others as may be perceived but he thought this addition would do no harm	81.34363555908203
monte cristo returned to his bedroom and glancing rapidly from the garden to the street he saw first <unk> who after walking to the end of the garden fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came in	61.126678466796875
the count alone seemed <unk> more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks	59.42626953125
<unk> was where d <unk> stands	106.73123931884766
is he prosperous and happy he died a more wretched hopeless heart-broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of <unk> a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of <unk> who turned away and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head	58.303070068359375
whom do you bring asked the young girl in <unk> of monte cristo is it a friend a brother a simple acquaintance or an <unk> a friend said monte cristo in the same language	42.59724426269531
the conditions are favorable what else was opera invented for no thank you	346.98309326171875
fortunately you have the <unk> the jewel is yours my dear athos	39.20418167114258
what do you see a <unk> of how many persons twenty <unk> what sort of men sixteen pioneers four <unk> how far distant five hundred <unk> good	92.45172882080078
with folded arms he gazed for some time upon the great city	168.78245544433594
the procurator s wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine horse	51.24116516113281
besides he wore the uniform of the guards which next to that of the musketeers was most admired by the ladies	59.39366149902344
sir no and i do not know what has become of him so that i am really so unhappy that i <unk> in fact tears rolled down his cheeks	36.47219467163086
<unk> inquired franz after the countess had a second time directed her <unk> at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor <unk> why that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a living <unk> this fresh allusion to <unk> drew a smile to franz s countenance although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him	67.31688690185547
in the first place i must be satisfied that you are the person i am in search <unk> what proofs do you require did you in the year 1814 or 1815 know anything of a young sailor named dant√®s dant√®s	63.95210647583008
d <unk> examined the countenances of his companions which like that of athos wore an impression of deep anxiety and they continued their route as fast as their horses could carry them but without adding another word	64.6795425415039
you seek me sir said he	22.162641525268555
i have no influence with any one	51.20148849487305
you have seen nothing that resembles him because he works by secret springs and moves by hidden ways	212.94996643066406
keep the lieutenancy my dear keep <unk> the young man then entered the apartment of aramis	64.13301849365234
it was at the brigantine that had left in the morning and the tartan that had just set sail that edmond fixed his eyes	55.462440490722656
now they will be far from looking for us among the puritans therefore with the puritans we must <unk> good my friend good said athos	77.572021484375
a last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested it	103.42501831054688
it is kept by a friend of <unk> at last we have something definite said athos let us go to the <unk> yes answered aramis but if we are to get there we must rest our horses for they are almost <unk> aramis was right they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine they gave them three hours rest and then set off again	57.51211929321289
explain it <unk> <unk> on the question being interpreted answered three without counting <unk> d <unk> understood for while replying the captain had raised three fingers	230.61764526367188
you will excuse this poor fellow madame he said as he preceded the baroness but his orders are precise and m. de villefort begged me to tell you that he could not act <unk> in the court showing his merchandise was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions	56.687992095947266
now the scripture says positively make a sacrifice unto the <unk> that is true said his antagonists	48.17061233520508
someone had just died in the house to which that garden belonged	145.84222412109375
the mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe i do not think it would be out of keeping even at this moment	59.58434295654297
d <unk> had calculated that in not going at once to the palais royal he would give comminges time to arrive before him and consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he d <unk> and his friend had rendered to the queen s party in the morning	57.30252456665039
the prince assigned to every one his post	110.52294158935547
i could not see the expression of his countenance but i felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was placed	45.9736442565918
what do you say asked his wife pale as death	41.8194580078125
all that however has nothing to do with my obligations to you and i now come to ask you whether in my own person my family or connections i can in any way serve you	63.7132568359375
but although her <unk> full and <unk> as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained shut	186.43162536621094
will you tell me that they did not lay siege to the h√¥tel of the duc de la <unk> and that they did not endeavor to burn it <unk> would not perhaps have been a great misfortune in time of war seeing that it is nothing but a nest of huguenots but which is in time of peace a frightful example	56.75709533691406
i do not know said the servant but the housemaid is in mademoiselle valentine s room perhaps she has emptied <unk> ask her said morrel translating <unk> s thought this time by his look	76.515869140625
adieu raoul said the count adieu my dearest boy adieu sir adieu my beloved <unk> athos waved his <unk> dared not trust himself to speak and raoul went away his head uncovered	88.51853942871094
but the story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the donjon and even outside	50.31778335571289
the recompense will exceed your expectations that is all i promise <unk> more intrigues	126.21393585205078
he wished to speak but his tongue refused to move	62.196815490722656
he received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton nightcap in the other	43.449806213378906
i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message	72.00021362304688
oh be assured if the memory of my brother were not sacred to me you should rot in a state dungeon or satisfy the curiosity of sailors at tyburn	99.7899398803711
<unk> had disappeared without his being able to discover what had become of her	37.943180084228516
at that moment the violins sounded the signal for the ballet	55.4554328918457
well at the end of ten days you would have taken a <unk> at the end of twenty days increasing another <unk> you would have taken three hundred <unk> that is to say a dose which you would support without inconvenience and which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken the same precautions as yourself	47.26432800292969
thank you cried he throwing himself on his horse	32.212833404541016
scarron followed their movements with a glance from the corner of his eye	61.873382568359375
i am free then sir cried dant√®s joyfully	49.36980438232422
i succeeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre of france	39.6625862121582
on the day after the morrow by eleven of the clock the two diamond studs were finished and they were so completely imitated so perfectly alike that buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones and experts in such matters would have been deceived as he was	60.49054718017578
<unk> lingered for a moment then taking leave of old dant√®s he went downstairs to rejoin <unk> who awaited him at the corner of the rue senac	46.493812561035156
you will see me talking with one of my friends the abb√© d <unk> of whom you have often heard me <unk> i remember him <unk> come near to us from time to time as if to speak but do not speak and do not listen	48.283931732177734
then having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything he went down again to <unk> shut the doors carefully and after convincing himself that no one was listening do you said he know anything of this young lady s illness yes said the old man	87.51146697998047
he had only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet when the procureur s footstep was heard in the passage	43.33277130126953
we should command an annuity of 175,000 livres	113.39479064941406
at the end of five hundred paces more or less they came to a rivulet which they forded	54.34980392456055
the junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the <unk> scarves whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of parisian belles	59.08224105834961
display is not becoming to everyone m. de <unk> at this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of spectators of this scene	83.99666595458984
i make the first advances said the king	21.6633243560791
but when the saddle and arms for grimaud were purchased athos had not a sou left of his hundred and fifty <unk>	91.08643341064453
she is young she is beautiful she possesses all earthly seductions	76.08375549316406
well then resumed faria with a bitter smile let me answer your question in full by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the ch√¢teau d if for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity and in all probability i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and <unk> dant√®s remained for a short time mute and motionless at length he said then you abandon all hope of escape i perceive its utter impossibility and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not <unk> nay be not discouraged	113.16053009033203
come come madame cried d <unk> seizing her hands and surveying her with an ardent glance come be more generous	43.02549743652344
all this time the soldiers were calling out stop	114.54505920410156
it is not natural for letters to enter people s houses in this manner	107.65028381347656
i have already told you father that woman under that angelic appearance had an infernal soul and when i saw her when i recalled all the evil she had done to <unk> to you	74.37846374511719
it seems however that i have unconsciously stumbled upon the <unk> still argued <unk> i would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened or at least that i had had no hand in it	63.844276428222656
the man of <unk> the crowd was caused not by the expectation of a man to be hanged but by the contemplation of a man who was hanged	36.664451599121094
in the first instance to marseilles <unk> to marseilles exclaimed the young couple	70.11583709716797
i myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these <unk> it seemed to me that i was in a dream and as it always happens in a dream i felt myself riveted to the spot	53.30031967163086
returned the influence of m. de <unk> like his own could be vastly increased and the marriage be still more suitable	111.8052749633789
copies were put up at the corners of the streets and even they who had begun to open negotiations interrupted them being resolved to await the succor so pompously announced	115.1873779296875
but after all said lord de winter when the three friends had been named we do not know who you are	36.127418518066406
in the centre of this court in the form of a horseshoe were the buildings occupied by mazarin and at each wing the pavilion or smaller building where d <unk> was confined and that level with the orangery where athos was to be	54.202510833740234
i was at school at the time and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the <unk> which would not prevent me said d <unk> if i knew where the duke of buckingham was from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the queen were it only to enrage the cardinal and if we could find means to play him a sharp turn i vow that i would voluntarily risk my head in doing <unk> and did the mercer rejoined athos tell you d <unk> that the queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter haberdasher she is afraid so. wait a minute then said aramis	73.26840209960938
haul up the cable and draw the boat to us said <unk>	71.74238586425781
ah you are quite the pet of the ladies monsieur porthos resumed the procurator s wife with a sigh	31.13316535949707
when mazarin ceased speaking he said to porthos in a low tone never tell mazarin that i understand spanish or i am a lost man and you are <unk> all right said porthos	61.88698959350586
i listen to your eminence with greatest attention replied a female voice which made the musketeer start	118.33894348144531
the last alternative seemed the most prudent so he waited until twelve of the clock	61.338714599609375
the rock yielded rolled over bounded from point to point and finally disappeared in the ocean	156.2620086669922
i am monsieur d <unk> a gascon gentleman serving in the king s musketeers	36.13928985595703
oh then let it be directly exclaimed the young man	47.580848693847656
what is this gentleman s name asked the commissary	22.016807556152344
he told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery	51.643917083740234
nay said she do not smile it ill accords with the expression of your countenance and i am sure it does not spring from your heart	37.68739318847656
monte cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary	87.11290740966797
he stopped at the door villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him then after a brief interval during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands m	40.0760498046875
the old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her	35.95820236206055
you are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in england added she with a melancholy smile and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done <unk> i am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders alas our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor incapable infirm old minister like me. well then your eminence said the queen i must inform you that charles i. my husband is on the eve of a decisive engagement	70.87759399414062
well well said monte cristo quietly i see you wish to quarrel with me but i would give you one piece of advice which you will do well to keep in mind	38.28300094604492
dant√®s perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by a look of grateful pleasure while merc√©d√®s glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to edmond	102.62769317626953
you are right father i understand <unk> then extending his hand towards one of the pistols he said there is one for you and one for <unk> morrel caught his hand	50.599884033203125
this harsh letter coming as it did from a man generally so polite and respectful struck a mortal blow at the pride of villefort	215.4454803466797
then he had eaten some without saying a word more <unk> therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the volga	69.0797348022461

they never overtook the chimerical friend yet andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed for a green cabriolet and bay horse and as there are a great many cabriolets to be seen on the road to the low countries and as nine-tenths of them are green the inquiries increased at every step	128.0001220703125

you know we can not yet pronounce him <unk> he is in safe custody answered villefort and rely upon it if the letter is found he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the <unk> and where is the unfortunate being asked ren√©e	81.78034973144531
he was placed before a large glass which reflected the whole apartment and so without any attempt to move which would have been impossible he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him	70.19120788574219
june and july were the terrible months with athos	505.08160400390625
nevertheless he continued in the tone of one who gives wholesome advice i think it is better not to make <unk> then said raoul this monsieur scarron is a poet yes you are warned vicomte	63.85471725463867
he is at <unk> did i say monsieur de beaufort	31.576148986816406
oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although i did not myself believe it i would not for the world have destroyed my father s faith	63.41023635864258
a <unk> yes i think i received a <unk> upon my <unk> brutes said d <unk>	24.4495849609375
she received him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages	61.2862663269043
a letter said the young man	17.62247657775879
then she threw herself upon her knees and began to pray	33.103546142578125
<unk> collected a store of crusts bazin who had always been inclined to devotion never quit the churches planchet watched the flight of flies and grimaud whom the general distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his master heaved sighs enough to soften the stones	130.41041564941406
and how does m. de villefort bear it as usual	67.3101806640625
albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day	106.300537109375
the races like the <unk> are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the carnival	57.92133712768555
the king took it with a trembling hand looked for the address which was wanting became very pale opened it slowly then seeing by the first words that it was addressed to the king of spain he read it rapidly	85.95779418945312
the duke looked at this strange figure with surprise	37.7852897644043
i have pledged my last jewels sold your clothes and my own to pay his servants who refused to accompany him unless i made this sacrifice	111.41416931152344
really madame he said did i alarm you much oh no sir she answered but you know things impress us differently according to the mood of our <unk> villefort forced a laugh	127.1307144165039
he reflected that this coalition of four young brave enterprising and active men ought to have some other object than swaggering walks fencing lessons and practical jokes more or less witty	68.48371124267578
i was as i told him resolved to die of hunger	55.811492919921875
the old marshal turned toward the viscount grateful for that praise of his son whilst the prince exclaimed the young man is right let the prisoner be brought in. meanwhile the prince took de guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had been taken and who this young man was	138.8062744140625
now sir pray do not be offended at the question i am about to put to you as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron	44.02211380004883
and now go <unk> before i go said mordaunt i have some questions and a favor to ask you <unk> a favor from me mordaunt bowed	82.69071197509766
but no one entered except two or three marines who brought her trunks and packages deposited them in a corner and retired without speaking	81.1523666381836
i must absolutely see it i shall find a <unk> no nonsense <unk> i will offer myself as <unk> the rooms are all <unk> well then i must be contented to imagine <unk> that is the best plan believe me. try at least to give me an idea of what it <unk> how can i nothing is easier	81.29097747802734
at a distance albert thought it was a complete suit for he counted from the ace to the ten	85.89360046386719
he was therefore silent and as athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth d <unk> s confidence stopped there	95.71605682373047
when a thing suited him he paid the price demanded without thinking to ask for any abatement	162.3255615234375
you understand this do you not my most precious wife	64.20268249511719
what is this wait your reverence there is a <unk> you know i have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalier i will break every bone in your body	49.37561798095703
so that you see there is a deadly feud between <unk> but said the envoy you do not go about it in the right way to kill him if i understand you <unk> aw said the englishman i practice shooting every day and every other day <unk> comes to my <unk> this was all the visitor wished to ascertain or rather all the englishman appeared to know	56.742942810058594
the following day about three of the clock a single blow struck on the gong summoned ali to the presence of the count	32.16206741333008
raised to the height of twenty feet so as to be on a level with the window it had two lower stories	83.22981262207031
for a mind so <unk> as that of d <unk> this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better future	84.06261444091797
he fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned him	25.90567970275879
they then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for milady	67.25531768798828
living you would feel shame at my name dead you may raise your head and say i am the son of him you killed because for the first time he has been compelled to break his <unk> the young man uttered a groan but appeared resigned	68.12898254394531
he remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to breathe	74.09371948242188
all this is perhaps <unk> insanity but tell me what woman has a lover more truly in love what queen a servant more ardent my lord my lord you invoke in your defense things which accuse you more strongly	170.00624084472656
but you do not know us when we can not have one thing we invent <unk> and have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody only to our host	84.69135284423828
besides you are right in another respect which is in thinking that if we were to meddle in politics there could not be a better time than the <unk> how can you know that	50.38152313232422
merc√©d√®s had no fire in that cold and naked <unk> who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house from the hall to the boudoir she had not even one little <unk> whose apartment had been a conservatory of costly exotics	79.15485382080078
in the chamber of d <unk> and porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and gagged	39.25604248046875
ah monseigneur continued <unk> throwing himself at his eminence s feet ah how truly you are the cardinal the great cardinal the man of genius whom all the world reveres the cardinal however contemptible might be the triumph gained over so vulgar a being as <unk> did not the less enjoy it for an instant then almost immediately as if a fresh thought has occurred a smile played upon his lips and he said offering his hand to the mercer rise my friend you are a worthy <unk> the cardinal has touched me with his hand	91.40570831298828
the conversation took place in <unk> language which d <unk> could not understand but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful englishwoman was in a great rage	60.49740982055664
how sir said planchet is it you eh	68.98799133300781
athos collected himself and in proportion as he did so d <unk> saw that he became pale	57.59684371948242
i am entirely at your service except only for my <unk> thank you sir what i am about to ask will not compromise you in any <unk> if it should even compromise me a little said monsieur de comminges with a smile still make your demand	71.64704132080078
he touched him on the shoulder	28.208980560302734
<unk> he looked at aramis and made a special sign to him with his head	28.92670249938965
he reached the instrument he had placed on the stand touched a spring and immediately a pale light just bright enough to render objects distinct was reflected on his hands and countenance	125.0699462890625
after a moment i fancied that i felt a slight pulsation of the heart and as i had been assistant at the hospital at bastia i did what a doctor would have <unk> inflated the lungs by blowing air into them and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it began to breathe and cried feebly	52.6374626159668
alas sir exclaimed barrois a great misfortune has happened	60.25172805786133
one of those three members was the coachman who had driven them there	79.39485168457031
what appears to you to emanate from a celestial source seems to me to proceed from one far less pure	92.31420135498047
and he is in paris continued he addressing raoul then turning to the queen we may still hope	74.19631958007812
they were assembled in council at the residence of athos which always indicated an event of some gravity	97.07476043701172
make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description and when you have met with an eligible spot visit it and if it possess the advantages desired purchase it at once in your own name	101.5622329711914
in consequence i embarked for oran and went from thence to constantine where i arrived just in time to witness the raising of the siege	63.822025299072266
in case of any attempt to escape the penalty of death is to be applied	44.36671447753906

on the morning of the eighth day bazin fresh as ever and smiling according to custom entered the cabaret of the <unk> as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast saying as had been agreed upon monsieur aramis the answer from your <unk> the four friends exchanged a joyful glance half of the work was done	107.69371795654297
i can not tell you how long we remained in this state at that period i did not even know what time meant	50.52040481567383
during the whole of this nocturnal ride during the whole time that he was endeavoring to understand the various characters of comminges <unk> and <unk> mazarin was in truth studying more especially one man	90.90011596679688
certainly and why should i regret what gives you pleasure oh	188.700927734375
they began by walking through the apartments many of which were fitted up in the eastern style with cushions and divans instead of beds and pipes instead of furniture	94.15226745605469
well said maximilian death came a third time and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a word	78.94911193847656
how they must be asking where is the cardinal what has become of the minister where has the favorite gone how they must be looking for monseigneur in all corners	130.7698974609375
in an hour inquired <unk> turning pale	85.14737701416016
you want to know how we came here	47.26863098144531
english and french the hour having come they went with their four lackeys to a spot behind the luxembourg given up to the feeding of goats	179.9314422607422

i suffered that is <unk> yes said mazarin as women suffer in avenging themselves	127.0341796875
oh you encourage me and something tells me there placing his hand on his heart that i ought to have no secret from <unk> you are right morrel god is speaking to your heart and your heart speaks to you	57.18067932128906
enough enough replied <unk> say no more about it i will take all the consequences upon <unk> and he began his story	96.30265045166016
well said the latter a young woman of about twenty-six or twenty-eight years of age and a man of from thirty-five to forty have indeed lodged at the two houses pointed out by your eminence but the woman left last night and the man this <unk> it was they cried the cardinal looking at the clock and now it is too late to have them pursued	68.51346588134766
milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions	110.30723571777344
at the same moment a violent crash was heard and cries of distress	17.5057315826416
reflect how glorious a day it will be how grand how solemn that day of complete restoration on which you will say in this very office my father died because he could not do what i have this day done but he died calmly and peaceably because in dying he knew what i should <unk> my father my father cried the young man why should you not live if i live all would be changed if i live interest would be converted into doubt pity into hostility if i live i am only a man who has broken his word failed in his <unk> fact only a bankrupt	137.15621948242188
the man who had the appearance of being a butcher descended a little steep and isolated street looking on to the river with two of his friends	48.92909622192383
for a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven	134.8621368408203
the two kingdoms are so near that france must be interested in our situation as we are interested in that of france	73.58757781982422
this time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to dant√®s and seeing that he received no reply go to the bed and thus discover all	73.4327163696289
i fear i shall be forced to suspend <unk> have you no friends who could assist you morrel smiled mournfully	66.04862213134766

this is not the h√¥tel des <unk> come you are growing discontented you are no longer happy you who only wish to live like a retired <unk> <unk> sighed	59.645172119140625

you will allow me to leave first then after half an hour you can go away in your <unk> yes monseigneur	41.73301315307617
i recognize grimaud by his long legs and his determined slouch	156.97447204589844

in whose name do you come said he to him	41.51396560668945
poor fellow remarked <unk> affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart	65.51368713378906
the curate then entered followed by planchet	91.01814270019531
maximilian maximilian he said the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a <unk> oh do not fear my friend said morrel raising his head and smiling with a sweet expression on the count i shall no longer attempt my <unk> then we are to have no more <unk> more despair no i have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a <unk> poor fellow what is it my grief will kill me of <unk> my friend said monte cristo with an expression of melancholy equal to his own listen to me	52.62004470825195
athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawing-room where there were several people	38.996185302734375
d <unk> was again in the presence of the circe who had before surrounded him with her enchantments	32.77535629272461
why do you remember when it forgets	56.326473236083984
aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head	34.534664154052734
it was indeed madame <unk> and her daughter whom valentine had seen they had been ushered into madame de villefort s room who had said she would receive them there	40.07831573486328
the natural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between the city and the mountains between civilized and savage life	78.96029663085938
well come set <unk> ah sir you are going to save my life a second time cried planchet	49.55702590942383
he waited silently striving to pierce through the darkness	71.07473754882812
it was a pledge a remembrance	78.57662200927734
this is all i can say sir if you wish to learn more address yourself to m. de <unk> the inspector of prisons no	37.24789047241211

he not only talked much but he talked loudly little caring we must render him that justice whether anybody listened to him or not	243.501220703125
planchet said d <unk> i am going out for all day perhaps	43.34635925292969
the salutation was so well understood that morrel with the same expression in his eyes placed his handkerchief to his mouth and these two living statues whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect separated from each other by the whole length of the room forgot themselves for a moment or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation	78.07618713378906
porthos opened his mouth to reply d <unk> made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually closed	45.06972885131836
the count took another spoon and again dipped it into the golden box	71.24238586425781
in this kind of game not to kill is to let one s self be killed	102.6803207397461
ask yourself wherefore after rescuing the infant from its living grave you did not restore it to its mother	198.72427368164062

everybody looked and listened with astonishment comprehending nothing of what passed	97.83253479003906
how i worked how i hoped how i struck every piece of turf thinking to find some resistance to my spade	316.04229736328125
in an instant from the door of the cabinet to the street gate the whole h√¥tel was boiling	33.16062545776367
we let them tell their story out replied <unk>	124.25640106201172
mazarin wrote a few words which he gave to this man then he bowed	60.86949920654297
a gentleman has but his word and i have given you <unk> with a heavy heart d <unk> again bent his way toward the ferry	62.74764633178711
a violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock two more forced out the bolts and the broken door fell in	138.30020141601562
what brings you to paris affairs of importance which you shall know later	126.92288970947266
this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled organs	53.607177734375
the frenchman threw her a bouquet teresa returned <unk> this with the consent of the chief who was in the <unk> what cried franz was luigi <unk> in the carriage with the roman peasants it was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied peppino	97.16256713867188

make use of it then whenever you think it will be most useful for my eldest son s welfare	91.15569305419922
ten minutes sufficed for their defeat and d <unk> remained master of the field of battle	53.09080123901367
why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited	75.20660400390625
he knows my tastes my caprices my wants	246.3503875732422
therefore leaving directions at every place for grimaud they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the lys	98.68695068359375
we will accept them the more readily since we have them not here you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the <unk> de <unk> at marseilles	51.540626525878906

she had many a time felt humiliated by the self-sacrifice and disinterestedness shown by the gascon gentleman	88.81880950927734
what has happened to you today to raise all these melancholy ideas this wound my dear d <unk> has been a warning to me from <unk> this wound	65.70734405517578

he must be <unk> do not attempt it he has revenged himself and has done well	68.65457916259766
d <unk> then remembered the injunction if you value your own life or that of those who love you remain motionless and as if you had seen <unk> he stopped therefore trembling not for himself but for the poor woman who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this rendezvous	110.27531433105469
then you know the men who are now on monte cristo oh yes we sailors are like freemasons and recognize each other by <unk> and do you think we have nothing to fear if we land nothing at all smugglers are not <unk> but these two corsican bandits said franz calculating the chances of peril	64.8909683227539

however they left the castle behind that was the principal thing	131.55111694335938
it was that paper you read this morning read it again dant√®s and then i will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected <unk> faria with an air of triumph offered the paper to dant√®s who this time read the following words traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust this 25th day of april 1498 be alexander <unk> and fearing that not he may desire to become my heir and re and bentivoglio who were poisoned my sole heir that i have bu and has visited with me that is in island of monte cristo all i poss jewels diamonds gems that i alone may amount to nearly two mil will find on raising the twentieth ro creek to the east in a right line	121.38396453857422
one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil or at least have cast down her thickly fringed lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes but on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say if you are my friends rejoice with me for i am very <unk> as soon as the bridal party came in sight of la r√©serve m. morrel descended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already given that dant√®s should be the successor to the late captain <unk>	98.0644302368164

now and then a jolt more violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes then he felt that he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same country thickly strewn with broken aqueducts which looked like granite giants petrified while running a race	72.9802474975586
at length happier than the young man who sobbed without weeping tears glistened in the eyes of <unk>	33.20201110839844

i think we are all taken prisoners except aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in mazarin s <unk> which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned d <unk>	84.80421447753906
the next morning he could not see or hear the jailer feared he was dangerously ill. edmond hoped he was dying	58.671958923339844
oh said monte cristo i allow of no excuse	75.23318481445312
but nothing could be farther from his thoughts	95.06063079833984
five minutes afterward bazin set off on a full trot urging on his horse by the blows of a <unk> which he was in the habit of using instead of a riding whip	46.84465026855469
to-morrow according to all probability we shall attack the <unk> but my lord said marshal de grammont consider that when we have collected all our forces we shall have hardly thirteen thousand <unk> monsieur le marechal said the prince with that wonderful glance that was peculiar to him it is with small armies that great battles are <unk> then turning toward the prisoner take away that man he said and keep him carefully in sight	98.5648193359375

besides maximilian morrel though hardly <unk> had great influence over his father	99.04415130615234
from the time d <unk> took quarters in that hotel the mistress of the house a pretty and fresh looking flemish woman twenty-five or twenty-six years old had been singularly interested in him and after certain love passages much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to whom a dozen times d <unk> had made a pretence of passing a sword through his body that husband had disappeared one fine morning after furtively selling certain choice lots of wine carrying away with him money and jewels	130.5380859375
because replied d <unk> the queen desired every one to leave and i thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the <unk> and you have been here <unk> about a quarter of an hour said d <unk> motioning to porthos not to contradict him	39.926273345947266
but d <unk> found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man complete except for the sword arranged along the wall	99.80021667480469
d <unk> refused but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into money	84.09705352783203
a light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor	53.700191497802734
m. de <unk> would doubtless give him good advice as to the whole affair	51.47154235839844
it was then into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young man advanced with a beating heart ranging his long rapier up his lanky leg and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap with that <unk> of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face	58.219947814941406
come hither said mazarin in his softest voice i have an order to give <unk> d <unk> bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase soon found himself in the study whence they had first set out	73.34642028808594
he was drawing in this circle geometrical lines and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as archimedes was when the soldier of marcellus slew him	81.89253997802734
it seems to me said d <unk> with a thousand livres <unk> do not speak as a spartan but as a <unk> this word <unk> roused porthos	37.06056213378906
well you do not answer cardinal what do you think about it i am thinking madame of the allusion made by that insolent gentleman whom you have caused to be arrested to the duke of <unk> him whom you allowed to be <unk> the duchess de chevreuse whom you suffered to be <unk> the duc de beaufort whom you imprisoned but if he made allusion to me it was because he is ignorant of the relation in which i stand to <unk> anne drew up as she always did when anything touched her pride	72.86202239990234
i tell you i am madame <unk> i tell you i belong to the queen cried the unfortunate woman	33.452720642089844

i could interpret one of your <unk> then you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so much renown instantly but on my part said milady how should i repay such a service	82.54722595214844

i will summon him <unk> it is useless he would not come <unk> to your apartments perhaps but he will not make any difficulty at entering <unk> the count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street and whistled in a peculiar manner	45.27055740356445
then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when i saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches deep	129.3491668701172
on arriving at the king s private antechamber m. de <unk> found la <unk> who informed him that they had not been able to find m. de la <unk> on the preceding evening at his h√¥tel that he returned too late to present himself at the louvre that he had only that moment arrived and that he was at that very hour with the king	30.845903396606445
he fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea doubtless these strange <unk> had heard his cry	100.50855255126953
i made no resistance i was no longer master of my senses	33.78804397583008

but it is a glorious day for me continued the young girl raising her ardent gaze to heaven that on which i find at last an opportunity of avenging my father the count had not uttered one word the whole of this time	55.704532623291016
an error i readily forgive but wilful negligence or forgetfulness never	527.0834350585938
because he left no commentaries replied la <unk> with his coarse laugh	75.2827377319336
madame replied de winter provided i can find some of my good old friends of former times i will answer for <unk> come then my lord said the queen with the painful doubt that is felt by those who have suffered much come and may heaven hear <unk> chapter xxxvii	63.169166564941406
at the outer door the steward paused	55.00388717651367
a few minutes more and the troop passed over their heads	31.87869644165039
one morning my father sent for us my mother had been crying all the night and was very wretched we found the pasha calm but paler than usual	149.75502014160156

athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he met	50.84452438354492
grimaud said athos put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the <unk> grimaud shuddered and nodding awaited the departure regarding the butt of his musket with silent eloquence	60.722145080566406
they both mingled as they had leave to do with the servants and peasants	94.59358215332031
porthos opened his mouth thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his turn d <unk> checked him by a glance from the corner of his eye	44.760765075683594
this order i believe i have accomplished with all the exactness of a soldier but also with the courtesy of a gentleman	51.79332733154297

he gave a ball every year at which he appeared for a quarter of an hour only <unk> is to say <unk> minutes less than the king is visible at his balls	111.24922180175781
i was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation that i am sure i was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude i feel toward you	91.4571533203125

while madame de villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror and villefort with his head hidden in the bedclothes saw nothing around him d <unk> approached the window that he might the better examine the contents of the glass and dipping the tip of his finger in tasted it	54.96631622314453
ren√©e regarded him with fond affection and certainly his handsome features lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover	113.91001892089844
in short he had reached that supreme moment when the bravest feel a shudder in their veins when suddenly in the direction of the rue de l <unk> the crowd opened crying long live the coadjutor and <unk> in surplice and cloak appeared moving tranquilly in the midst of the fusillade and bestowing his benedictions to the right and left as undisturbed as if he were leading a procession of the fete dieu	72.44114685058594
i am older than your eminence although i possess not your wisdom	65.20256805419922

felton in his rapid walk reviewed in his mind all the accusations against the favorite of james i. and charles i. furnished by two years of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the puritans	65.99440002441406
it is a piece of good fortune sent from heaven said athos evidently much relieved	106.23131561279297

mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own sentence but continued to compassionate the fate of <unk> concini	95.07698822021484
yes monsieur we are cousins said porthos without being disconcerted as he had never reckoned upon being received enthusiastically by the husband	60.2071533203125

the two guards who had remained in the lane mounted to the aid of comminges those who were in the chariot opened the doors and presented arms	61.380699157714844
at this sight the young man stopped short not in admiration of raphael s picture but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible object	55.8789176940918
but how did it happen that such a great princess became a slave how was it that dionysius the tyrant became a schoolmaster	90.24370574951172

as he was finishing this work the sound of horses prancing in the yard and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window attracted his attention	57.985477447509766
then they lift and sink again and both go under at once	201.427490234375
they advanced towards a boat which a <unk> officer held by a chain near the quay	109.66368865966797

the unknown spurred his horse to a gallop	62.93885803222656
now one evening when d <unk> who was in the trenches was not able to accompany them athos porthos and aramis mounted on their battle steeds enveloped in their war cloaks with their hands upon their pistol butts were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to <unk> following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard as we have stated for fear of an ambuscade when about a quarter of a league from the village of <unk> they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them	68.90031433105469
he moved away walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts and then went back and listened	75.4317626953125
his air of perfect serenity made mazarin uneasy	349.49114990234375

her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but the children of her imagination and the conviction was strengthened by the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal phantoms who disappeared with the coming of daylight	102.12853240966797
then she knew that he was one of the friends of m. de <unk> and consequently that he belonged body and soul to the king which would make him lose a part of his advantage since when known to milady as he knew her he played only an equal game with her	63.77633285522461

as they were passing onward athos proposed that they should lay aside their arms and military costume and assume a dress more suited to the city	96.83467102050781

they were surrounded by a crowd of people who opened a way for us to pass when suddenly my mother having looked closely at an object which was attracting their attention uttered a piercing cry and fell to the ground pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the gates and beneath which were inscribed these words <unk> is the head of ali <unk> pasha of <unk> i cried bitterly and tried to raise my mother from the earth but she was dead	91.75265502929688

he was a relentless enemy that damned cardinal continued aramis glancing at the portrait of the old minister	89.7987060546875
as to lord de winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on milady and when she was come he recommended the prisoner who was still fainting to her care and left them alone	61.727928161621094

then i admit my patience failed me i drew my sword in my turn and as he came back to the charge i fancied i felt that in throwing himself upon me he let it pass through his body	65.94212341308594
one can no more now reckon on one s friends than on one s footmen said porthos	130.27578735351562
so i will not abandon this <unk> <unk> returned franz laughing in token of your <unk> the jest however soon appeared to become earnest for when albert and franz again encountered the carriage with the <unk> the one who had thrown the violets to albert clapped her hands when she beheld them in his <unk>	101.00813293457031

the hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice who goes there who goes there yourselves replied one of the horsemen	130.6178436279297
are you still friends with monsieur porthos and monsieur aramis add monsieur d <unk> my lord	56.17921447753906

the stranger placed the point of his sword at his throat and monsieur porthos finding himself at the mercy of his adversary acknowledged himself conquered	60.17211151123047
when the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near he wished for solitude his agitation was extreme a simple question from a friend would have irritated him	110.48057556152344

all i have is at his <unk> the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching <unk> even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent you are i presume m. <unk> yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it i am gaspard <unk> at your <unk> gaspard <unk> rejoined the priest	126.70357513427734
i was observing you both when you were walking in the garden and on my honor without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of mademoiselle <unk> i can not understand how any man can really love <unk> the fact is maximilian that i was there and my presence had the effect of rendering you unjust in your <unk> no but tell <unk> is a question of simple curiosity and which was suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to mademoiselle <unk> i dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say	78.5328369140625

but they could discern nothing but a man of middle height dressed in black apparently of a certain age for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his features	75.06361389160156
you must have discovered a mine or else become a <unk> so that as you confess you are jealous no i am <unk> pleased that i wished to congratulate you but as i am not quite properly dressed i chose my opportunity that i might not compromise <unk> yes and a fine opportunity you have chosen exclaimed andrea you speak to me before my <unk> how can i help that my boy	86.79662322998047

he thought that voice more feeble than usual	80.30641174316406
it has its own effect upon the most incredulous and far from being incredulous mazarin was superstitious	138.18740844726562
why said he does not the emperor who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of improving the art of war organize a regiment of lawyers judges and legal practitioners sending them in the hottest fire the enemy could maintain and using them to save better men you see my dear that for picturesque expression and generosity of spirit there is not much to choose between the language of either party	109.65766906738281

now the <unk> us make <unk> portmanteau stop said louise going to listen at madame <unk> door	154.02296447753906
you are a brave <unk> as i told you monsieur replied planchet picards are found out by being used	58.258663177490234
a thunder of applause saluted its appearance half the camp was at the barrier	142.4422607421875
apropos continued he franz is coming soon but it will not interest you you dislike him i think i said monte cristo my dear viscount how have you discovered that i did not like m. franz	78.08106231689453
while he was doing this d <unk> having no better employment amused himself with beating a march upon the window and with looking at the musketeers who went away one after another following them with his eyes until they disappeared	121.19536590576172
but first said morrel allow me sir to tell you who i am how much i love mademoiselle valentine and what are my designs respecting <unk> <unk> made a sign that he would listen	66.91709899902344
they thought this order did not concern me sir nevertheless if you wish it i am ready to <unk> ah	60.907676696777344
with two companions yes replied the duke	64.10424041748047
it was there that my father ruined by the revolution and m. <unk> who never had possessed any patrimony both laid the foundations of their different <unk> yes said monte cristo i think m. <unk> mentioned that in a visit which i paid him and continued he casting a <unk> at lucien who was turning over the leaves of an album mademoiselle eug√©nie is <unk> think i remember that to be her <unk> very pretty or rather very beautiful replied albert but of that style of beauty which i do not appreciate i am an ungrateful <unk> you speak as if you were already her <unk> ah returned albert in his turn looking around to see what lucien was doing	79.92195129394531
i will go there where i expect to find letters and you go to the first tavern in the town to l epee du grand henri for instance refresh yourselves and in two hours be upon the jetty our boat is waiting for us <unk> the matter being thus decided the two friends found about two hundred paces further the tavern indicated	72.47362518310547
excuse me mr. president he said in a clear voice but i see you are going to adopt a course of questions through which i can not follow you	44.75196075439453
i will pay twenty-five piastres for my passage back to leghorn	139.5223388671875
at the language you <unk> what do you find so astonishing in that language said milady smiling	57.508445739746094
la <unk> drew near to grimaud who spoke to him in a low voice	17.963756561279297
when i leave him i place in my stead a bold fellow who aspires to be his majesty s special guard	90.70856475830078
what do you want with me my friend said aramis with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the church	46.068138122558594
sir cried morrel seizing the moist hand of the paralytic they ask me who i am and what right i have to be here	71.79238891601562
he opened at once his little eyes and his great mouth to inhale better the joke his eminence deigned to address to him and ended by a burst of laughter so violent that his great limbs shook in hilarity as they would have done in an ague	82.49691009521484
their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages	120.12493133544922
the young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his neighbor	39.316104888916016
there are only fifteen feet more from the top down here and the grass is <unk> the duke had already begun to descend	62.058441162109375
this embarrassment had completely escaped albert but it caused lucien to shorten his visit he was evidently ill at ease	189.2681884765625
stop and let us <unk> talking with you brings me misfortune said porthos	95.131591796875
yes sir replied julie with hesitation what is your pleasure	63.81399154663086
you have come then at last	36.110137939453125
as a further precaution they had bound his hands	113.65008544921875
i have more than once intended witnessing an execution but i have never been able to make up my mind and you albert i replied the viscount i saw castaing executed but i think i was rather intoxicated that day for i had quitted college the same morning and we had passed the previous night at a <unk> besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at paris that you should not see one anywhere else when you travel it is to see everything	70.05689239501953
his eminence will continue to be prime minister and her majesty s favorite if he will grant to me and my friends what we demand for france and for <unk> occupy yourselves with your own affairs gentlemen and let france settle matters as she will with me resumed mazarin	109.46598815917969
at twelve this man was replaced by another functionary and <unk> wishing to catch sight of his new guardian approached the door again	93.11563873291016
ah said valentine the thing you desire begins with the letter n it is with n that we have to do then	84.63096618652344
the two oarsmen bent to their work and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the quai d orl√©ans	43.655677795410156
he preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage then suddenly <unk> his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it he mounted and galloped off in the direction of paris	82.0990219116211
but i too have had the idea you have and two or three times the same fancy has come over me but i have always given it up	56.05951690673828
now sir said albert if you think my apology sufficient pray give me your hand	123.68559265136719
you see then felton i can do nothing but die	63.67459487915039
as he gained the top of the rue <unk> he saw two persons coming out of the rue dauphine whose appearance very much struck him	71.91405487060547
well he asked that will do will it not yes my lord on one <unk> what that grimaud shall wait on us at <unk> nothing could be more agreeable to the duke however he had presence of mind enough to exclaim to the devil with your grimaud	134.6075897216797
speak said athos we can not see your signs	60.43095779418945
yours is a noble <unk> he said here is your <unk> raoul bent his knee to the ground	50.880977630615234
this time maximilian was the first to arrive	55.53770446777344
then the demigod vanished he remained scarcely a man	104.67839813232422
at length she rallied drew aside the curtain and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on valentine	83.97820281982422
it is an axiom of criminal law and consequently you understand its full <unk> <unk> sir continued villefort there is something to fear besides death old age and madness	82.30083465576172
it would be exceedingly <unk> the gascon with his vivid imagination had already seen the advantage to be derived from his situation	42.900211334228516
my first impulse on coming to myself was to feel under my pillow for the knife i had not been able to reach if it had not been useful for defense it might at least serve for expiation	74.7637710571289
the poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts and i found myself in the house	120.6275863647461
monsieur he said after a moment they tell me great things of you	50.402610778808594
they will know you are deserted and think you also poor for i alone know your real financial position and am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest <unk> the dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this was equalled by the calm indifference with which debray had spoken	108.45704650878906
but to return to what you were saying <unk> well do you know why they die so <unk> at m. de villefort s <unk> is good said <unk>	36.59536361694336
good said he as he went away this is a fruitful soil and i feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren <unk> next morning faithful to his promise he sent the prescription requested	90.57475280761719
go now at once or i shall have you put <unk> i looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further entreaty	63.825252532958984
five minutes elapsed during which franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the campagna and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion	53.456207275390625
d <unk> immediately placed the point of his sword at his throat	27.023191452026367
but said he did you observe one very singular thing what how attentively he looked at <unk> at me <unk> albert reflected	105.67707824707031
then all his suspicions were confirmed the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the forest	54.00050354003906
the family began to get accustomed to their obscurity	91.17477416992188
madame he said you have wished to conquer the prince your <unk> is to say the greatest captain of the age and when women of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it	73.34844970703125
well of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the masters for which we will draw lots	70.61302185058594
nothing nothing only shut the window	169.9511260986328
and the four friends rushed out of the fort gained the field of battle picked up the four muskets of the privates and the <unk> of the brigadier and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till they reached the city turned again toward the bastion bearing with them the trophies of their victory	53.906307220458984
the captain was only waiting for his passengers hardly had they put foot on deck ere her head was turned towards hastings where they were to disembark	69.47313690185547
<unk> therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task	141.8284149169922
well now i have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this little madame <unk> who is that her <unk> what is his name oh your eminence knows him well cried milady carried away by her anger	68.08487701416016
this chamber was a sort of garret situated in the rue des <unk> near the luxembourg	22.17682647705078
you have a quick ear monsieur athos said the cardinal but now listen to this	65.75460815429688
as for denying that i am your nephew you will think twice about it now that i have learned some things of which i was ignorant a year <unk> and how does it concern me what you have learned said de winter	50.62935256958008
ah captain said the officer everything is quiet <unk> i did not know that something is going on in yonder house and he pointed to a magnificent hotel situated on the very spot whereon the vaudeville now stands	72.70848083496094
count he said you are not the same here as in <unk> how so here you <unk> the count s brow became clouded	60.54722213745117
however what had you to say to me he resumed let us return to that <unk> with pleasure replied d <unk> i must however first frankly tell you that you must change your mode of <unk> how go into harness again gird on your sword run after adventures and leave as in old times a little of your fat on the <unk> ah	95.03252410888672
there as in every spot where monte cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease	119.61388397216797
monte cristo saw nothing but the shadow which no one else observed	81.43627166748047
there was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night but each of those strokes which made up the expected hour vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man	36.27680587768555
i have four harriers which are considered the swiftest in the county and a pack of hounds which are unequalled for twenty leagues <unk> and porthos heaved another sigh	56.039310455322266
on the right and on the left of the road which the dismal procession pursued appeared a few low stunted trees which looked like deformed dwarfs crouching down to watch men traveling at this sinister hour	71.58990478515625
i promise you it affords <unk> as little pleasure to revive it as it does you	126.10859680175781
thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words tomorrow sir i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on <unk> and i sir said <unk> shall be most happy to receive <unk> upon which he offered to take cavalcanti in his carriage to the h√¥tel des princes if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son	62.69019317626953
besides the count will be in his own house and only see them when he thinks fit to do so. thanks monsieur said monte cristo i shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband if you will do me the honor to introduce me but i can not accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen since my habitation is already <unk> what cried <unk> you are then going to a <unk> will be very dull for <unk> was i so badly lodged at rome said monte cristo smiling	52.71835708618164
i see them about twenty paces behind my lord	53.10238265991211
the noise was caused by porthos who had just knocked down his man	50.04368591308594
you need not awaken the coachman ali will <unk> in a very short time the noise of wheels was heard and the carriage stopped at the door	34.28667068481445
i invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as <unk> you are then a chemist somewhat i know lavoisier and was the intimate friend of <unk> but for such a work you must have needed <unk> you any i had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at rome but after reading them over many times i found out that with one hundred and fifty well-chosen books a man possesses if not a complete summary of all human knowledge at least all that a man need really know	122.86647033691406
ali pasha was killed as you know but before he died he recompensed the services of fernand by leaving him a considerable sum with which he returned to france when he was gazetted <unk> so that <unk> inquired the abb√©	82.72187042236328
the face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask but notwithstanding this precaution which was in fact taken rather against others than against him he at once recognized his usual guide the light and intelligent mme	111.72506713867188
in truth said porthos i understand but <unk> about the middle of the rue des petits champs they were stopped by a second patrol	33.09968566894531
what do you want with a notary again repeated villefort	47.6845588684082
with that you may be satisfied he can make his way both going and <unk> in that case said athos planchet must receive seven hundred livres for going and seven hundred livres for coming back and bazin three hundred livres for going and three hundred livres for <unk> will reduce the sum to five thousand livres	77.78351593017578
i am an officer of fortune nothing else i have nothing but what my sword brings me <unk> is to say more blows than banknotes	49.194297790527344
if there was a beautiful lily or a sweet rose you had to search for it concealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban or an aunt with a bird-of-paradise	108.37582397460938
you have already tried the power of your seductions upon many men and unfortunately you have always succeeded but i give you leave to try them upon this one	96.29832458496094
then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes which he tried many times to close but in <unk> opened again as soon as shut	151.9276123046875
having aroused the enmity of the sultan he was proscribed and put to death by treachery in 1822 at the age of <unk>	83.00465393066406
during the period that the duc de <unk> passed in the <unk> he remained for twelve long <unk> his companions in their dreams of liberty said to each other as for me i shall go out of the prison at such a time and another at such and such a time the duke used to answer as for me gentlemen i shall leave only when monsieur du tremblay leaves meaning that at the death of the cardinal du tremblay would certainly lose his place at the <unk> and de <unk> regain his at court	87.20172119140625
a woman lay on the ground her head resting on the knees of a man who was seated by her as he raised his head the woman s face became visible	32.26058578491211
all the way along d <unk> had been consulting with himself whether he should place confidence in m. de <unk> or whether he should only ask him to give him <unk> <unk> for some secret affair	60.792659759521484
i think that a man must be so severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no other <unk> who told you that i loved him asked milady sharply	38.457576751708984
silence whispered the duke she has her <unk> she will ruin us returned the prince	100.32573699951172
if this ship founders like the others he is a ruined <unk> and has the unfortunate man wife or children inquired the abb√©	76.2907943725586
pardon me then a fault which is perhaps great but which certainly was <unk> milady was so beautiful at this moment the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance that felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before heard	74.403076171875
i can never forgive myself monsieur said louis <unk> i command you to <unk> well sire the usurper left elba on the 26th february and landed on the 1st of <unk> and where	65.14482116699219
i would as willingly accuse myself	74.3442153930664
the four friends during the period of these two absences had as may well be supposed the eye on the watch the nose to the wind and the ear on the hark	91.385009765625
ah sir do leave a few crowns for me at the gate that i may have some things i am in need of it shall be done replied <unk>	51.80381393432617
and what a coat sir for a prince of the cavalcanti the keeper turned his back and shrugged his shoulders he did not even laugh at what would have caused anyone else to do so he had heard so many utter the same things <unk> he heard nothing else	72.81684112548828
but at all events i gave him absolution in articulo mortis	31.9585018157959
in these days the throne is too dangerous a place for me to wish him to retain it	70.23292541503906
luigi <unk> what think you of that inquired franz	105.24691772460938
he looked around he was in a court surrounded by high walls he heard the measured tread of sentinels and as they passed before the light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine	48.31938934326172
and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the helvetian who received him with great coldness	54.42306137084961
the young men sprang up and seized their muskets	56.33329391479492
i intrust to you certain papers which are at blois and in two months and a half if you do not hear of us take possession of them	61.05900573730469
athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his <unk> falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with agitation	79.61465454101562
the sentiments you air are certainly fine so fine that they are <unk> however that may be d <unk> replied athos without falling into the snare which his gascon friend had prepared for him by an appeal to his parental love however that may be you know in the bottom of your heart that it is true but i am wrong to dispute with my master	87.5691909790039
everything that savors of mystery charms them	300.1193542480469
then as it was cold he asked for his gown which was brought to him	52.10211944580078
the cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice and the king was very pale	16.616392135620117
nothing will ever go well with us hereafter oh heaven	297.7125244140625
they ask my age i tell it	115.78939056396484
<unk> when her husband had shut the street door and she found herself alone that imbecile lacked but one thing to become a <unk>	52.74576187133789
morrel i possess nearly a hundred millions and i give them to you with such a fortune you can attain every wish	98.05072784423828
merc√©d√®s was much changed within the last few days not that even in her days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in a plain and simple attire nor indeed had she fallen into that state of depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery no the change in merc√©d√®s was that her eye no longer sparkled her lips no longer smiled and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit	171.97021484375
i know not i merely suppose so as i might suppose anything else replied villefort with a look so fixed it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and madness	71.24537658691406
these thoughts gilded as they were by a last reflection of love were not the less sad	138.9497833251953
it was those very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful and the blow was so great he rushed out overcome and forgot to shut the door	98.36846923828125
beauchamp is a worthy fellow said monte cristo when the journalist was gone is he not albert yes and a sincere friend i love him devotedly	76.3746566772461
you see then said albert that instead of opposing she will encourage me. adieu then until five of the clock be punctual and we shall arrive at twelve or <unk> at <unk> yes or in the <unk> but can we travel forty-eight leagues in eight hours easily said monte cristo	70.75552368164062
at this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened and a woman appeared	34.097843170166016
still they may have concealed some precious stone some valuable diamond so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their treasures	109.06536865234375
parry too started and stopped reading	753.75634765625
the leader closed the window came out an instant after by the door and satisfied himself that the woman was in the carriage	52.2700080871582
no we shall beat them by merely temporizing	146.52890014648438
believe me madame i had entirely forgotten <unk> but it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend madame de villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me. <unk> this time at least i do not deserve your thanks	61.24329376220703
no longer could edmond look into those wide-open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed	92.63720703125
and then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor merc√©d√®s who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son	65.24893951416016
that is the hour when i am <unk> madame said the young man bowing i can refuse nothing asked of me thus	57.267478942871094
should you like to be rich and your own master <unk> said the young man was it possible there could be two answers to such a question take the <unk> which you will find waiting at the porte de <unk> as you enter nice pass through turin chamb√©ry and <unk>	54.316898345947266
like a <unk> <unk> returned at this moment alone	60.50038528442383
you do not answer madame exclaimed the terrible interrogator	51.250022888183594
sir said he i am chief clerk of the house of thomson french of rome	19.6851749420166
then accustomed to passive obedience he jumped down from the terrace ran toward the lane and at the end of twenty paces met d <unk> who having seen all was coming to him	58.27691650390625
monsieur de mazarin is not a man of genius as i thought he is a man of no <unk> a servant of cardinal bentivoglio and he got on by intrigue	43.54766845703125
he was supplied with bread of a finer whiter quality than the usual prison fare and even regaled each sunday with a small quantity of wine	98.70841979980469
the same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated the instant afterward the flaming globe descended afresh and i was completely alone	136.6263885498047
before he had taken ten steps beyond the door i had examined the house on all sides	49.27725601196289
you certainly are a demon sent upon the earth said athos	91.19878387451172
villefort met them at the door of his study having in a few words thanked the district doctor he turned to d <unk> and said and now the <unk> is there any particular priest you wish to pray with valentine asked d <unk>	68.00016784667969
ah monsieur porthos cried the procurator s wife when she was assured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the locality could either see or hear her ah monsieur porthos you are a great conqueror as it appears i madame said porthos drawing himself up proudly how so the signs just now and the holy water	68.98141479492188
the devil exclaimed porthos there is vulcan <unk> zounds cried d <unk> then we must stop	44.75190734863281
this was simply because he lived in the h√¥tel	76.26609802246094
anyone but a man of <unk> thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward s extraordinary repugnance for the count s projected drive without the walls but the count was too curious to let <unk> off from this little journey	121.89717102050781
by a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven of the clock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity	52.28194808959961
i have my pride for <unk> always ready to threaten everyone who would pass without crushing them under foot	181.0914764404297
by an incredible effort of will i even raised myself up but only to sink down again immediately and to fall into the arms of my <unk> tell me who this man was cried the young officer	66.41322326660156
towards the close of the first act the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened a lady entered to whom franz had been introduced in paris where indeed he had imagined she still was	92.02111053466797

who then has so correctly informed you asked he for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof and yet we are more interested than you in exposing m. de <unk> as he is a peer of france and we are of the <unk> oh that is very simple we have not sought to scandalize	72.10599517822266
i felt in bending my head toward you your beautiful hair touch my cheek and every time that it touched me i trembled from head to foot	134.529052734375
i have dined many times with him and the count of <unk> so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate them a little we might meet in the same <unk> come your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong <unk> that is all very fine benedetto mio but i know what i am saying	59.63235092163086
yes ali himself my nubian mute whom you saw i think at <unk> certainly said <unk> i recollect him perfectly	142.5113525390625
all i ask is that villefort will be firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles	74.55540466308594
more than this the conversation which had just taken place between merc√©d√®s and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them	71.16019439697266
d <unk> was in a dolorous situation which he had not foreseen	27.311952590942383
not one of them will do as he says he murmured with his little monkey smile but they may do as they please the brave gentlemen	104.82999420166016
the first prince of the blood the king s uncle no	78.63663482666016
does anyone dare to slander me monsieur i told you that i considered it best to avoid all <unk> then sir i am patiently to submit to your refusal yes sir although i assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive for i had reckoned on the honor of your alliance and the breaking off of a marriage contract always injures the lady more than the <unk> enough sir said <unk> we will speak no more on the <unk> and clutching his gloves in anger he left the apartment	80.9717788696289
i only wait till you give <unk> you will go to buckingham in my behalf and you will tell him i am acquainted with all the preparations he has made but that they give me no uneasiness since at the first step he takes i will ruin the <unk> will he believe that your eminence is in a position to accomplish the threat thus made yes for i have the <unk> i must be able to present these proofs for his <unk> without doubt	67.55213165283203
it appears to me you make dull jokes my dear said porthos	38.78523254394531
he took his way toward the h√¥tel of m. de <unk> his visit of the day before it is to be remembered had been very short and very little <unk>	34.9216194152832
we ought never to despair of softening the heart of a mother who loves her child	72.8814468383789
now you are rich said monte cristo	18.26402473449707
then the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the cellar	78.32875061035156
these men are going to behead your father	32.09083557128906
then having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor on his own he glanced towards the door	38.09206008911133
he remained there all night not knowing where he was	132.75723266601562
that comforts me a <unk> has he wit or <unk> demon d <unk> said porthos astonished at his friend s deception	62.9268798828125
where has he gone i do not <unk> what do you mean	25.837846755981445
he is a young ingenuous pure man who seems virtuous him there are means of <unk> and milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her lips	40.832725524902344
he opened the conversation about rain and fine weather the travelers replied	207.67349243164062
madame de villefort instantly stepped back close to the wall and there shaded by the <unk> she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of valentine	74.41890716552734
fatality meantime milady drunk with passion roaring on the deck like a lioness that has been embarked had been tempted to throw herself into the sea that she might regain the coast for she could not get rid of the thought that she had been insulted by d <unk> threatened by athos and that she had quit france without being revenged on them	77.74895477294922
at length athos after serious reflection and becoming more pale than usual made a sign of assent to d <unk> who by it understood he was at liberty to speak	50.745208740234375
i would confide my life to them but i should hesitate ere i trusted them with your majesty s. well said athos since you have not a regiment we are three devoted men	90.07569885253906
the horses went like the wind and in a few minutes they were at the gates of london	31.056241989135742
<unk> whose fire at one time repulsed the royal regiment thought that the moment was come to pursue it but it was reformed and led again to the charge by the duc de chatillon in person	74.75300598144531
always the <unk> the child s corpse coming every night in my dreams rising from the earth and hovering over the grave with menacing look and gesture	142.1759796142578
seven of his eminence s guards placed <unk> de <unk> by you four in two days	115.17720794677734
at that instant the moon inquisitive perhaps like d <unk> came from behind a cloud and by her light d <unk> recognized the large blue eyes the golden hair and the classic head of the duchess de longueville	51.94565963745117
a friend maximilian and who is this friend	111.1202392578125
my fortune though small is free and unfettered and the memory of my late father is respected in our country valentine as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city i say our country because you were born not far from <unk> do not speak of marseilles i beg of you maximilian that one word brings back my mother to my <unk> angel mother who died too soon for myself and all who knew her but who after watching over her child during the brief period allotted to her in this world now i fondly hope watches from her home in heaven	122.054443359375
monsieur du tremblay received d <unk> with extreme politeness and invited him to sit down with him to supper of which he was himself about to partake	43.908023834228516
be easy i am a gentleman	54.98694610595703
he waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere and then went on	122.93269348144531
gentlemen did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall	59.042274475097656
i know that you were one of them my uncle and that you cried louder than the others she must <unk> therefore i warn you and listen well to my words that they may be engraved upon your memory never to be forgotten this murder which has robbed me of <unk> murder which has deprived me of my <unk> murder which has impoverished <unk> murder which has made me corrupt wicked <unk> shall summon you to account for it first and then those who were your accomplices when i discover them with hatred in his eyes foaming at his mouth and his fist extended mordaunt had advanced one more step a threatening terrible step toward de winter	96.87647247314453
milady in the course of the conversation twice or thrice bit her lips she had to deal with a gascon who played close	67.77670288085938
my father cried the young girl out of breath and half dead with <unk> saved you are saved and she threw herself into his arms holding in her extended hand a red netted silk purse	69.93566131591797
oh dear <unk> are you worse exclaimed valentine perceiving all these signs of agitation	82.32286071777344
they have perhaps some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival firm	94.9217529296875
you would like one that sails as rapidly <unk> lightning interrupted mordaunt	174.50025939941406
so much the better for me sir if you speak to me as you say with <unk> then you will do me the honor to esteem the resemblance of our opinions but if you have entertained any doubt as naturally you may i feel that i am ruining myself by speaking the truth	41.436866760253906
i have no design upon your count and you shall have him all to yourself	55.18107986450195
begone then to your beautiful duchess i will detain you no <unk> and she is not to be despised in my <unk> now monsieur porthos once more and this is the last	78.73553466796875
the musketeers are as you know picked soldiers and they require many things useless to the guardsmen or the <unk> but yet detail them to me. why they may amount <unk> said porthos who preferred discussing the total to taking them one by one	144.29798889160156
suddenly the daylight began to fade away franz took out his <unk> was half-past four	119.00554656982422
at that moment bazin entered with the spinach and the omelet	28.042659759521484
you will take a biscuit with it will you not yes i will take a biscuit as you are so <unk> monte cristo rang <unk> appeared	40.404571533203125
but said madame <unk> resolving to make a last effort this young man though a murderer is an orphan abandoned by <unk> so much the worse or rather so much the better it has been so ordained that he may have none to weep his <unk> but this is trampling on the weak <unk> the weakness of a murderer his dishonor reflects upon <unk> is not death in my house oh sir exclaimed the baroness you are without pity for others well then i tell you they will have no mercy on you be it so said villefort raising his arms to heaven with a threatening gesture	60.133880615234375
his family will inherit fifteen thousand louis a year from him	87.06124877929688
oh if he knows the contents of this murmured he and that <unk> is the father of villefort i am lost and he fixed his eyes upon edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts	47.14999771118164
first you purchase a house at <unk> house is the one where i have committed an assassination you descend to the garden by the same staircase by which he descended you stop at the spot where he received the blow and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child	87.98506927490234
m. de <unk> being informed of this by his eminence packed his portmanteau and as without knowing the because he knew the great desire and even imperative need which his friends had of returning to paris it goes without saying that he fixed upon them to form part of the escort	80.20733642578125
the cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of paper wrote some lines upon it whilst d <unk> stood imperturbable without showing either impatience or curiosity	71.6816635131836
<unk> thought for ten minutes about his wife in paris another ten minutes about his daughter travelling with mademoiselle d <unk> the same period was given to his creditors and the manner in which he intended spending their money and then having no subject left for contemplation he shut his eyes and fell asleep	88.36161804199219
nonsense said d <unk> you would do as much mr. humanity in a battle	82.70585632324219
i was generally liked on board and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves i feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me	156.7003173828125
to be kept in strict solitary confinement and to be closely watched and guarded	144.2309112548828

you make me young and happy again by it	113.01229858398438
the cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of his terrible <unk> he comprehended the strange qualities of this woman sometimes a serpent sometimes a lion	92.18140411376953
and this time the tone and manner in which the command was given <unk> such growing hostility that the two young men perceived for the first time that the mandate was addressed to them	60.944339752197266
well these boards you hear unloaded are the posts and planks to build my scaffold	121.3600082397461
you have had a proof of that in what you have just related to me. this too was the opinion of comminges who withdrew somewhat reassured	67.61600494384766

say to him that when he is alone it will help us if he will knock on the floor for then i can continue my work in safety	80.92503356933594
i do not think so answered the other he is too stupid to imagine such a scheme	38.70809555053711
that continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but likewise from a plan i have marked out with respect to <unk> d <unk> became more and more astonished	63.58557891845703
but to return to our <unk> well then you wish to know if i am of mazarin s party	32.10940933227539
you know i hate moralizing except when it is done by athos	69.7717514038086
but let us be <unk> king may change his mind in an hour and at all events it is more difficult to replace a man in the fort l <unk> or the bastille who has got out than to keep a prisoner there who is in. m. de <unk> made his entrance triumphantly into the fort l <unk> whence he delivered the musketeer whose peaceful indifference had not for a moment abandoned him	65.28644561767578
in royal <unk> it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not to be seen at all	75.2035903930664
no emmanuel i am but a man and your admiration is as unmerited as your words are <unk> and pressing his lips on the hand of julie who rushed into his arms he extended his other hand to emmanuel then tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness he made a sign to maximilian who followed him passively with the indifference which had been perceptible in him ever since the death of valentine had so stunned him	67.21139526367188
the prince leaped to his feet extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound there was no mistaking <unk> was the noise of cannon	60.161983489990234

there ensued a brief silence during which these two persons who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race examined each other without embarrassment on either side	196.7627410888672
that is why i have uttered the words for which you blame me that is why i have filled this whole assembly with horror	59.84798812866211

de villefort he said will you conduct the baroness <unk> villefort complied and they passed on to the dining-room	79.68962860107422
d <unk> had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner to whom this man had confided some important missive	43.86962127685547
anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy	101.6944808959961
thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding her hints she persisted in watching all night	74.18489074707031
listen i am already upon the scent resumed d <unk>	81.88328552246094

i have sent for three of my friends but who knows whether they were at home yes yes	35.90731430053711

you blackguard cried athos going toward him i will cut your ears off at the same instant four men armed to the teeth entered by side doors and rushed upon athos	100.84916687011719

he took <unk> one side while the young girl seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made a veil of her picturesque head-dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits	41.36018371582031
captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is <unk> electricity lightning from lightning <unk> no replied dant√®s	74.71622467041016

d <unk> unfolded it with one hand whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal to read december 3 1627 it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done	58.11183547973633
alas said felton i can do but one thing which is to pity you if you prove to me you are a victim	43.15406799316406
i will allow you to make me hateful but i will prevent your rendering me ridiculous and above all i forbid you to ruin me. the baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of villefort had been pronounced but then she became pale and rising as if touched by a spring she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition she then took two or three steps towards her husband as though to tear the secret from him of which he was ignorant or which he withheld from some odious calculation <unk> as all his calculations were	76.02522277832031
madame said albert allow me to present to you m. maximilian morrel captain of spahis one of our best and above all of our bravest <unk> i have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil at the house of the count of monte cristo replied madame de villefort turning away with marked coldness of manner	43.67739486694336
they passed in silence through the little village of festubert where the wounded servant was and then skirted the wood of richebourg	61.4484977722168
it would have signified little had the room been empty but unfortunately it was occupied	143.42356872558594
it was nothing but a plan of attack against the cardinal	37.47825622558594
from valentine the young man looked towards <unk>	64.41120147705078
but what is going on in the city yonder said athos	29.111141204833984
i do not know her but a sort of intuition tells me she is a lost creature and that there is something fatal about <unk> you are right said d <unk> i will have done with her	35.4140510559082
i see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward <unk> i think replied porthos it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre again it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way and a failure would be ruinous	70.25141143798828
although d <unk> was not of a very sentimental character the mercer s pretty wife had made a real impression upon his heart	44.45951461791992

when i see her majesty embarrassed i shall conduct her to rueil make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a <unk> enough sir muttered the cardinal you have said enough where is the treaty here it is replied aramis	107.09650421142578
milady had likewise the best of <unk> beauty her noble appearance and the liberality with which she distributed her <unk>	96.49152374267578
let us see with your thousand crowns from the abbey and the twelve thousand francs you make by selling sermons are you rich	61.46660614013672
i faith aramis believe me there is little left to regret	167.0245361328125

meanwhile what are you going to do i yes <unk> it is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me. since you interest yourself in my affairs i think it is now my turn to ask you some <unk> ah true	53.04977035522461
there was a study for emmanuel who never studied and a <unk> for julie who never played	199.3777618408203
no positively i will not go	117.92728424072266
5 scott of course the son of an ill-fated sire and the father of a yet more unfortunate family bore in his looks that cast of inauspicious melancholy by which the <unk> of that time pretended to distinguish those who were predestined to a violent and unhappy <unk> <unk> abbot ch	82.29997253417969
the next morning when kitty presented herself at d <unk> s she was no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days but on the contrary sad as death	52.422645568847656
it is probable you are ignorant of this little fact said athos	29.10504150390625
did you not once refuse to undertake a journey to brussels for the queen ah	67.35519409179688
that has cured me of beautiful poetical and loving women said athos after a considerable pause raising his head and forgetting to continue the fiction of the count	87.22525787353516
what is he waiting for asked another	109.3547592163086
as he came near the hotel franz saw a man in the middle of the street	22.96977424621582
there are a few things that you can do with most project <unk> electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement	20.288837432861328
a few shots were fired and one musketeer was wounded	59.21917724609375
all three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the alert	44.46928787231445
do you think that i sorrow for madame <unk>	45.32651138305664
as to the astute aramis he did not entertain much dread of him and supposing he should be able to get so far he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least by hitting him in the face as c√¶sar recommended his soldiers do to those of pompey to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud	83.7470703125
he had himself a daughter about her age but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her mother having been consumptive	88.77880096435547
it seemed to him that if porthos and aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it but that athos on the contrary would despise him	46.90657424926758
ah monsieur said he after having vainly searched on the <unk> and the shelves i have not got any <unk> take one of the <unk> <unk> said the count and show me the <unk> the steward obeyed in silence but it was easy to see from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled how much it cost him to obey	47.45596694946289
i answered in <unk> then said he write to <unk> and who thus advised you no other than your friend monte <unk> the count of monte cristo told you to write to yanina yes and i wrote and will show you my correspondence if you <unk> albert and beauchamp looked at each other	53.07929992675781

these gentlemen wage war on private account and in buying them up by granting them what they wished monsieur le cardinal has made a good bargain	68.06245422363281
athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or stunned	67.8552474975586
but you have been traveling these four days as you told me yourself	56.983341217041016
captivity the first day chapter liii	65.18898010253906
the count received him with his habitual smile	31.03361701965332
all at once she paused a livid flash darted from her eyes she ran to the table emptied into mme	76.05970764160156
the king was closeted with the cardinal and m. de <unk> was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that moment	24.48732566833496
i will be an abb√© if it suits me	55.861976623535156
this assurance determined the two friends to accept it	112.077880859375
felton began to descend the ladder slowly step by step	124.76294708251953

porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just demolished	87.82084655761719

i never knew till now the delight of speed said <unk> and the last cloud disappeared from his brow but where the devil do you get such horses	125.28363037109375
it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind	64.6747055053711
the baron has just related a frightful story to me. milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim and shook her head	85.48348999023438
oh good lord said kitty in a low voice what is the matter with you	22.318294525146484

franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle	59.626861572265625
after casting a rapid glance around him in order to assure himself that he was unobserved he entered by the small gate and carefully closing and securing it after him proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier	52.376670837402344
come my dear bazin tell me where he <unk> did not you hear me tell you monsieur d <unk> that i do not know where he is yes certainly but to that i answer that it is <unk> it is nevertheless the truth <unk> pure truth the truth of the good <unk> d <unk> saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of aramis but whose lies were bold and decided	61.397239685058594
they had not seen him for two days	25.01302146911621
come here <unk> bazin who was crossing the <unk> majestically in his clerical dress turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing them	112.0152587890625
four years ago <unk> was at <unk> count is the old sailor you saw in the garden and who from quartermaster has become <unk> when he was at trieste saw on the quay an englishman who was on the point of embarking on board a yacht and he recognized him as the person who called on my father the fifth of june 1829 and who wrote me this letter on the fifth of september	62.30257797241211
aramis blushing in spite of himself took the letter which was in a large coarse hand and not particular for its orthography	63.295894622802734
ah my lord he said have you come to drive away those rascal spaniards and those lorraine robbers yes said the prince if you will serve me as <unk> willingly my lord	64.5304183959961

master <unk> is being <unk> it was <unk> s voice and dame nanette feeling herself supported recommenced with all her strength to sound her shrilly squawk	88.16876983642578
in about ten minutes d <unk> appeared at the door followed by the inseparable porthos	28.238788604736328
a convulsive movement again brought him to the surface	67.18083190917969
change these lackeys said he she has spoken to them	139.2801971435547
on the contrary there is not an hour we have passed together that is not present to my <unk> yes yes said porthos trying to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whilst he had been alone	46.79473114013672
the old man appeared to be listening attentively and as affectionately as his infirmities would allow to the abb√© busoni who looked cold and calm as usual	55.939064025878906
they will return said d <unk>	21.68851089477539
it does not appear to be very clean in the <unk> d <unk> glanced down at his boots all covered with mud but that same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer and it might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap	53.66459655761719
to no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous <unk> more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a king s ransom in his waistcoat pocket	88.79856872558594

perhaps you liked what m. <unk> said another sign in the negative	107.18653106689453
there said monte cristo placing his arms around the count and leaning with him over the front of the box just as hayd√©e whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale features close to <unk> s face	69.9439697265625
what do you wish gentlemen who are you said the same voice in the same commanding tone	29.392786026000977
ah you have a noble heart said the count so much the <unk> this exclamation which corresponded to the count s own thought rather than to what albert was saying surprised everybody and especially morrel who looked at monte cristo with wonder	63.93225860595703
charles was perceived through the door lying dressed upon his bed at the head of which parry was seated reading in a low voice a chapter from the bible	66.65596008300781
before an hour has passed you will be discovered arrested obliged to kill me which would be a crime unworthy of loyal gentlemen like <unk> he is right thought athos	94.11998748779297
no said she i do not remember it just at this moment but if it should occur to me presently i will tell <unk> albert was on the point of pronouncing his father s name when monte cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach the young man recollected his promise and was silent	39.098934173583984
chapter <unk> how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches not on the same night as he had stated but the next morning the count of monte cristo went out by the barri√®re d enfer taking the road to orl√©ans	37.76626968383789

the young girl rose instantly but the man lay on the earth struggling in the agonies of death	52.68320846557617
a candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer far less calm	92.8191909790039
thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on a rock or undulating in the vessel one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses	104.55363464355469
remember that the queen awaits you and after the queen the cardinal and after the cardinal <unk> d <unk> summoned anne of austria s servant and signified that he was ready to follow him into the queen s presence	37.94407653808594

if they catch thee thou wilt be <unk> true replied grimaud	87.53274536132812
nevertheless as the crossroads offered him a better chance than any other place of meeting somebody he stood still	162.6377716064453
this morning he made two or three exits worthy of didier or <unk> at this moment a fresh visitor entered and according to custom franz gave up his seat to him	52.759056091308594

the watchword is king and <unk> saying these words the cardinal saluted the three friends with an inclination of his head and took the right hand followed by his <unk> that night he himself slept in the camp	62.22562026977539
excitement like enthusiasm sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of earth	417.7861633300781

porthos comprehended that this chest although it did not correspond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams must be the blessed coffer and he congratulated himself that the reality was several feet higher than the dream	114.81759643554688
has it ever happened to you said monte cristo	22.003772735595703
we will see gentlemen we will see	46.455604553222656

the duke meanwhile recovered his self-control	108.05321502685547
it is all as he has said it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and <unk> then turning towards the paralytic he said you possess then 900,000 francs of capital which according to the manner in which you have invested it ought to bring in an income of about 40,000 livres <unk> to whom do you desire to leave this fortune oh said madame de villefort there is not much doubt on that subject	47.37781524658203

you are mad dear <unk> judge not rashly say the gospel and the cardinal replied athos	62.14704132080078
and the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous <unk>	63.402976989746094
he will have fallen asleep waiting for me or else he will have returned home where he will have learned that a woman had been there	47.564369201660156

the memory of richelieu annihilates me	38.66611862182617
albert related it to his mother <unk> recounted it at the jockey club and debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister even beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of the count s courage and gallantry thereby celebrating him as the greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the aristocracy	60.730892181396484
you can understand dear friend with what hope i was inspired by that last letter	114.6527099609375
morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also disappeared	71.5876235961914
athos sighed deeply the sigh woke the king so lightly did he sleep	124.97367095947266
and yet this nature so distinguished this creature so beautiful this essence so fine was seen to turn <unk> toward material life as old men turn toward physical and moral imbecility	242.1418914794922
milady s robe was not the less stained with blood in a second	66.0988998413086

now on such a day i can neither eat flesh nor see it eaten	194.1314697265625

this disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess who are still as much united although married more than twenty years as on the first day of their <unk> <unk> monte cristo glanced rapidly at albert as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his heart	52.2193489074707

your very grateful milady <unk> that is all very simple said d <unk> i expected this letter	51.03787612915039

i am giving them the slip said eug√©nie this woman to whom we have given twenty louis may betray us for forty we will soon alter our <unk> and the young girl jumped into the <unk> which was admirably arranged for sleeping in without scarcely touching the step	108.33418273925781

then it appeared to him that monte cristo smiled not with the strange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the secrets of his heart but with the benevolent kindness of a father for a child	54.055442810058594
if it is only to be recognized why the saddle will suffice for that it is quite remarkable enough	63.010353088378906

i shall call you <unk> patrick went out	38.47311019897461
when you spoke to me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger i placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service asking no other reward than the pleasure of being useful to you and have i ever since by word or look given you because of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you	99.76410675048828

everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had done at their first rapid survey	138.94520568847656
all the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy between life and death which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the <unk> sublime spot a resting-place full of poetry and character and at which franz had already halted five or six times and at each time found it more marvellous and striking	81.13959503173828
they immediately all three halted closed in and waited occupying the middle of the road	63.42514419555664
it can not be wondered at that his mind generally so courageous but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions love and fear was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts	81.1698989868164
arrested he exclaimed he was taken at compi√®gne and all is <unk> madame <unk> rose from her seat pale and cold	76.86935424804688

well then see here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his <unk> gentleman only a simple magistrate who learned more than you with all your police and who would have saved my crown if like you he had the power of directing a <unk> the look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on villefort who bent his head in modest triumph	86.55055236816406
at that instant he felt himself ready to reveal all	51.538665771484375
aramis after a journey into lorraine disappeared all at once and ceased to write to his friends they learned at a later period through mme	142.13204956054688

at a hundred paces from the gates of calais d <unk> s horse gave out and could not by any means be made to get up again the blood flowing from his eyes and his nose	52.5749626159668
then he turned again to the clock counting time now not by minutes but by seconds	211.95082092285156
vainglorious as he was porthos could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold but had at least half	107.00983428955078

d <unk> porthos and aramis rose and in one spontaneous motion rushed to their swords	34.47964096069336
he determined to cultivate the good-will of the youth raoul and either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the athos of old times with the athos of the present	134.9276123046875
will these be in your way he said to the executioner raising his long locks if so they can be tied <unk> charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown headsman	94.72754669189453

the door at last opened albert de <unk> entered first and i began to hope my fears were vain when after him another young man advanced and the count exclaimed ah here is the baron franz d <unk> i summoned all my strength and courage to my support	100.92945861816406
this foraging did not occupy more than half an hour	44.731163024902344
it is true the letter of the cardinal spada was singularly circumstantial and dant√®s repeated it to himself from one end to the other for he had not forgotten a word	42.50101089477539
25th april 149 well said faria when the young man had finished reading it	61.246097564697266
oh i will be revenged i believed that madame loved <unk> i love him	65.84004211425781
no you sounded me nothing more	180.3026580810547
the captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the palais royal	75.00032806396484
her hands clutched her armchair she ground her teeth inwardly her eyes followed the motion of the door as it closed behind lord de winter and felton and the moment she was alone a fresh fit of despair seized her	64.49005889892578
i must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away so says she gazing into the glass which reflects back to her eyes the burning glance by which she appears to interrogate herself	72.07557678222656
let them take my fortune i am already too rich and perhaps when they have taken it they will leave me in peace and quietness	76.72456359863281
try again whispered the count who depended on the secret spring which was unknown to the <unk> clever as he might <unk> try again you have a few minutes work <unk> and he advanced to the window	83.48041534423828
the house is sold then demanded the concierge and this gentleman is coming to live here yes my friend returned the count and i will endeavor to give you no because to regret your old <unk> oh monsieur said the concierge i shall not have much because to regret him for he came here but seldom it is five years since he was here last and he did well to sell the house for it did not bring him in anything at <unk> what was the name of your old master said monte cristo	48.278079986572266
a paper may be <unk> you are right only let me know where to find you that i may not run needlessly about the <unk> that is correct wait do you want a map oh i know this country marvelously you	71.03716278076172
stop a <unk> this is it <unk> danaos et dona <unk> which means beware of the enemy who makes you <unk> this diamond does not come from an enemy monsieur replied d <unk> it comes from the <unk> from the queen	62.103111267089844
what are you doing asked the coadjutor	12.507880210876465
at sight of this man d <unk> started and half drawing his sword sprang toward the door	36.64710998535156
from lord de winter repeated buckingham let him come in. felton entered	87.65437316894531
the king was winning and as he was very avaricious he was in an excellent humor	30.484634399414062
it was only to fight as an amateur	49.38710021972656
monsieur your friend pardon for not calling him by the honorable name which no doubt he bears but we do not know that name monsieur your friend having disabled two men with his pistols retreated fighting with his sword with which he disabled one of my men and stunned me with a blow of the flat side of <unk> you villain will you finish cried d <unk> <unk> has become of athos while fighting and retreating as i have told monseigneur he found the door of the cellar stairs behind him and as the door was open he took out the key and barricaded himself inside	98.20321655273438
an imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procureur	42.22887420654297
the cavalier in the gilt cuirass fell upon aramis and struck a blow that aramis parried with his <unk> skill	70.69256591796875
it seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise men who did not wish to be seen would not light a <unk> oh that goes for nothing said gaetano	63.5844841003418
ja in the most german and the least gascon accent possible	180.01100158691406
the soul forms its own horizons your soul is darkened and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and <unk> that may possibly be true said maximilian and he again subsided into his thoughtful mood	118.67562103271484
signor <unk> who had been accustomed to see them dine together inquired into the because of his absence but franz merely replied that albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had accepted	70.9806137084961
i know a man who will find the means of taking me from paris a man i have too long <unk> then falling into a reverie she added however with an expression of joy ungrateful woman that i am for twenty years i have forgotten this man whom i ought to have made a marechal of france	44.04053497314453
and monsieur d <unk> of whom you spoke just now monsieur d <unk> may i ask if you have any news of him we parted from him four days ago and we have reason to believe that he has reached paris before <unk> no sir i am sure he has not yet arrived	43.699317932128906
i speak as i can i restrain myself	56.46641540527344
and the guardsman d <unk> still my young <unk>	115.87582397460938
what is life to you <unk>	71.56916046142578
his eminence can not see the letter without the bearer of it replied the young man but to convince you that i am really the bearer of a letter see here it is and kindly add continued he that i am not a simple messenger but an envoy <unk> <unk> re-entered the cabinet returning in a few seconds	62.50471115112305
how old was she franz assured me replied albert that she was sixty-six years old	82.02893829345703
i am repulsed on all <unk> what it is so indeed mademoiselle eug√©nie scarcely answers me and mademoiselle d <unk> her confidant does not speak to me at <unk> but the father has the greatest regard possible for you said monte cristo	58.692413330078125
my lord has forgotten the <unk> no but i have forgotten monsieur <unk> my lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be <unk> go on then have it your own <unk> come here my lad said la <unk> and hear what i have to <unk> grimaud approached with a very sullen expression on his face	52.495262145996094
thus the greater number of a man s errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity then after error has been committed in a moment of excitement of delirium or of fear we see that we might have avoided and escaped it	121.59442138671875
the abb√© busoni said la <unk>	21.112001419067383
i began to fear that he would not come	38.7499885559082
i understood that i had nothing to fear that i should neither be seen nor heard so i decided upon descending to the garden	76.89732360839844
grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away and i am convinced they would have left us in <unk> i doubt that replied d <unk> for they are advancing very resolutely	56.55738830566406
ay but said aramis that young fellow is decidedly a <unk> which is the young man asked de winter turning around	54.127017974853516
how are you sir asked morrel with a sickness of heart	40.080169677734375
i was sensible that i could look for no support from a man disappointed in his hopes of an inheritance	121.83499145507812
you ask what god is doing	173.8531036376953
paris this odious paris waking up one morning without queen or king surrounded besieged <unk> for its sole resource its stupid parliament and their coadjutor with crooked limbs charming	684.2482299804688
porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabbard	55.354774475097656
what is this said aramis on seeing them arrive	66.29864501953125
however he toiled on all the night without being discouraged but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle	65.93866729736328
will that satisfy you must this last formality take place in your presence sir inquired a turnkey	122.76170349121094
must you know all absolutely and rather from your lips than another s. muster up all your courage then for never have you required it <unk> albert passed his hand over his forehead as if to try his strength as a man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends his sword	78.286376953125
loose <unk> imposing the king s musketeers or rather m. de <unk> s spread themselves about in the cabarets in the public walks and the public sports shouting twisting their mustaches clanking their swords and taking great pleasure in annoying the guards of the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them then drawing in the open streets as if it were the best of all possible sports sometimes killed but sure in that case to be both wept and avenged often killing others but then certain of not rotting in prison m. de <unk> being there to claim them	124.45142364501953
yes he murmured yes be <unk> his head dropped upon his chest and in this position he paced his study then he threw himself dressed as he was upon a sofa less to sleep than to rest his limbs cramped with cold and study	125.09971618652344
i am going down there to pronounce the sentence of death against a murderer	60.147926330566406
now said aramis we know how the matter stands	57.818546295166016
it was the island of <unk>	17.20701789855957
oh my god i have suffered enough surely	81.78666687011719
just as he was passing the count s box the door opened and monte cristo came forth	31.213911056518555
now say if i conceal anything from you no and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion and your princely father is he rich very rich yes he is that he does not himself know the amount of his <unk> is it possible it is evident enough to me who am always at his house	78.46025848388672
do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted asked the abb√©	48.20925521850586
now this was a sunday and the abb√© had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him	46.56782913208008
these four frenchmen have escaped from newcastle and no doubt want to carry off the king	80.46702575683594
he is a perfect nobleman very polite modest and agreeable such as may be found constantly in italy descendants of very ancient families	114.84382629394531
but i am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly <unk> how have i deviated from those principles monsieur asked monte cristo who could not help looking at morrel with so much intensity that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance	59.57172775268555
then he thought it was time to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple lips of faria and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat	61.224693298339844
he cast a rapid glance around the room and perceived that one of his men was missing	22.402650833129883
tell us news of yourself as often as you can that is to say as often as you can with safety	81.22607421875
as i am of the church and the affair might injure me if i should share it with any other than a sure friend like you i write to beg that you will serve me as second	66.88092803955078
aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutor s misfortune and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct when athos stopped him	94.31685638427734
aramis saluted then turning toward athos i do not care to camp on the place royale with all these people he said	87.20188903808594
oh i have been base cowardly i tell you i have abjured my affections and like all renegades i am of evil omen to those who surround me no merc√©d√®s said monte cristo no you judge yourself with too much severity	55.73316955566406
planchet who was still a little concerned for his safety after his recent escapade declared that he would follow d <unk> even to the end of the world either by the road to the right or by that to the left only he begged his former master to set out in the evening for greater security to himself	60.20583724975586
at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down	32.902854919433594
and now at last said the queen now that we are alone repeat your counsel monsieur le <unk> it is this madame that you should appear to have reflected and publicly acknowledge an error which constitutes the extra strength of a strong government release <unk> from prison and give him back to the <unk> oh cried anne to humble myself thus	88.1885757446289
their vows were sacred and irrevocable	109.16808319091797
ah dear constance i have found you then i see you at last and milady stretched out her arms to mme	43.6234130859375
you are among friends said athos in english so cheer up and tell us if you have the strength to do so what has happened the king muttered the wounded man the king is a <unk> you have seen him asked aramis in the same language	35.17067337036133
in the court he found <unk> who with a rouleau of a hundred francs in either hand seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them	51.852783203125
and do you comprehend grimaud said aramis	35.48119354248047
and on this assurance the four friends who had finished their modest repast separated with the promise of meeting again that evening	72.7721939086914
he turned around and seized his new antagonist by the wrist when he started back exclaiming raoul raoul cried athos	78.88758850097656
<unk> could not close his eyes not because his dungeon was so very disagreeable but because his uneasiness was so great	102.20658111572266
but that same night he found himself the possessor of a fine house situated on the boulevard de la madeleine and an income of 50,000 livres	42.93101119995117
as he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a cry	29.58295249938965
i broke my word it is true but what signifies that	75.89167785644531
ah my lord it is a great happiness that the queen who always wished you well had a fancy to send you here where there is a promenade and a tennis court good air and a good <unk> in short answered the duke if i comprehend you aright la <unk> i am ungrateful for having ever thought of leaving this place oh	78.77448272705078
a great age you mean monsieur porthos	137.87542724609375
this is the second time that monsieur d <unk> has been in england	22.82162857055664
the iron box was <unk> one had touched <unk> a beautiful <unk> my father had planted the day i was born which overshadowed the spot	117.7392807006836
my friend said he here is a proof of <unk> <unk> albert opened the paper it was an attestation of four notable inhabitants of yanina proving that colonel fernand mondego in the service of ali <unk> had surrendered the castle for two million crowns	34.44790267944336
it is quite wonderful said albert	25.21175765991211
will that do <unk> replied m. de <unk>	57.09760665893555
the day was passed at saint peter s alone	48.95877456665039
help me <unk> me your assistance <unk> looked at the dictionary	60.17733383178711
as he approached it <unk> s gaze followed him and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart	46.12915802001953
i said a million replied <unk> with the confidence of ignorance	86.03768157958984
the devil take the constitutional government and since we had our choice as they say at least how could we choose that i understand you must lay in a stock of <unk> do not run down m. <unk> speeches said debray he votes for you for he belongs to the <unk> <unk> that is exactly the worst of all	70.95023345947266
<unk> eh <unk> said the individual whose description we have twice given entering the door what a great deal of ceremony	134.46388244628906
it is not civil war that <unk> us	34.270267486572266
our clothes have a cut which would proclaim the frenchman at first sight	166.78648376464844
ah you fellows are good managers	87.3846206665039
the gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other guard at his <unk> but his mother	105.7270278930664
sire said athos we foresaw this and if lord winter s men but do their duty we are saved instead of <unk> at this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses winter s voice crying out sword in hand at these words every sword was drawn and glittered in the air like lightning	102.47087097167969
come forget him for a moment and instead of pursuing him let him <unk> you are too late madame the orders are <unk> well should he be <unk> they think they will arrest him i hope so. if they should arrest him i know that sometimes prisons afford means of escape will you leave him in prison the procureur shook his head	74.96772003173828
at this moment a horse without a rider covered with foam his nostrils extended and eyes all fire galloped up and recognizing his master stopped and <unk> with pleasure it was arthur	91.16703796386719
in that case said he i should lose her and by my own <unk> he dwelt on this idea for a moment then it appeared reality	62.61016082763672
let us call one of these lackeys with a <unk> in the left <unk> exactly so cried aramis	43.25157165527344
the cardinal made an approving gesture and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in coming	42.815303802490234
now as a <unk> was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily imagined	37.43051528930664
six days had already passed out of the ten he had asked from mordaunt he was therefore occupied in revising his reply to cromwell when some one knocked gently at the door of communication with the queen s apartments	75.00394439697266
that is unpardonable in a man of your age and who besides has such a pretty wife as <unk> oh lord	58.09138870239258
do you come from the end of the world said monte cristo you a journalist the husband of renown	28.981895446777344
i sometimes wonder replied athos smiling at that <unk> which recalled the good old days that we could form an association of men who would be after twenty years of separation still so closely bound together	113.17326354980469
monsieur d <unk> is a young man scarcely nineteen or twenty and this gentleman must be thirty at least	40.23046112060547
if on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight of the clock in the evening you are not here no <unk> if it be but five minutes past <unk> then monsieur said planchet you must buy me a <unk> take this said athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good lad	38.825218200683594
<unk> uttered a kind of hoarse rattling sound the old man s eyes sparkled and the good doctor understood that he wished to behold his child	38.63324737548828
this is all i know but i know not count how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of rome who ordinarily have so little respect for anything	101.6531753540039
the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt	89.85755920410156
gentlemen said he you have heard the comte de <unk> s defence	20.791385650634766
they search her she resists they use <unk> scoundrels in spite of his prudence d <unk> restrained himself with great difficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on below	93.86384582519531
athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd	70.57454681396484
do you think anything else was to be expected of them asked comminges who putting together what mazarin had said of his prisoners and what the comte de la fere had said began to feel a degree of uneasiness	71.40662384033203
when he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the count had gone out about half an hour previously	28.117782592773438
two inches an hour does not seem much but in twelve hours that makes two feet and three we had before that makes five	194.73828125
she had succeeded d <unk> was then in her power	37.47603988647461
is this carriage for me said dant√®s	47.33024978637695
i have measures to <unk> she will escape us replied the young man she will escape us and it will be your fault <unk> i will be accountable for her said athos	39.87743377685547
julie trembled at this request which seemed to her of bad omen	75.4741439819336
the two ladies entered the drawing-room with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication	54.61265182495117
you gave your direction to no one but your <unk> yet i have your address and in proof i am here the very instant you are going to sit at table	78.81359100341797
at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and <unk> saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome	47.08789825439453
albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point	99.83081817626953
in this case milady would cross the garden and gain the village on foot	93.12096405029297
i thought for a long time that he was dumb he answers only by signs	89.3659439086914
the queen will never banish me and even were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield with me if i fly she will fly and then we shall see how the rebels will get on without either king or queen	90.82022857666016
in the name of the queen i forbid you to throw yourself into any peril which is foreign to that of your <unk> and do you command nothing in your own name in my name said mme	42.71970748901367
i wish them to be promulgated <unk> but my lord if the lord chancellor interrogates me upon the motives which may have led your grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure what shall i reply that such is my pleasure and that i answer for my will to no <unk> will that be the answer replied the secretary smiling which he must transmit to his majesty if by chance his majesty should have the curiosity to know why no vessel is to leave any of the ports of great britain you are right mr. jackson replied buckingham	86.26576232910156
mazarin went to the right hand and aramis could see the prisoner disappear at the turning of the avenue	39.92781448364258
could you allow me a few words in <unk> what did i tell you said the governor	26.643470764160156
can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last said athos	50.71830749511719
d <unk> would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk for he knew well that to mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform	91.11901092529297
i was thinking my dear old friend that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church and now that you are an abb√© you are perpetually longing to be once more a <unk> it is true man as you know said aramis is a strange animal made up of contradictions	55.76765060424805
three months passed and still she <unk> news of edmond no news of fernand no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair	124.55442810058594
what shall we do <unk> why the same we had intended doing three days <unk> <unk> what <unk> you are not now going to be married you intend <unk> listen louise	97.3976058959961
the apartment of m. <unk> then became a mousetrap and whoever appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinal s people	76.48365783691406
i have said what i have said. and as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation replied d <unk> in a low voice i beg you to follow me. and when asked the guardsman with the same jeering air	47.11970138549805
ah said <unk> there goes a happy man and it so happened albert was not mistaken in his opinion	61.12702941894531
it is you who have told me that you had a secret to confide in me	27.187292098999023
during the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy with his companions porthos and aramis they could remember having often seen him smile but had never heard him laugh	70.02519226074219
you know or you do not know that that is what we ask of <unk> oh	35.195526123046875
ten parts of a hundred <unk> each in ten throws without revenge in thirteen throws i had lost <unk> thirteen throws	144.48248291015625
the guide held the door open	62.83863830566406
edmond found some solace in these ideas	193.2406005859375
well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man tonight	63.22762680053711
i can not resist doing so he must <unk> zounds replied d <unk> why do not you give yourself up directly feet and hands bound to that wretch	130.38722229003906
the latter took in the whole scene at a glance	50.191925048828125
how happy i am at this word <unk> athos who had seated himself quietly started up	93.51190948486328
the footman opened the door and announced monsieur le comte de la fere	19.963865280151367
the keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took andrea by the hands and began examining his person attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the lions den to something more substantial than mere fascination	65.37114715576172
you see said the king that it is useless for you to resist	33.20781326293945
at length after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken a carriage appeared coming at a quick pace on the road of s√®vres	41.79153060913086
i have engaged the three lower windows at the caf√© <unk> should i have obtained the requisite pardon for peppino the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks and the centre with white having a large cross in red marked on <unk> and whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution send one of your men disguised as a penitent friar and i will give it to him	98.24382781982422

there was something mournful solemn and terrible in the count s manner	78.0721664428711
grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys and the stable boys had beaten him	37.283241271972656
i was worn out with fatigue	53.466060638427734
then he added in a low tone yes that is the <unk> and then he again plunged into a train of thought the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile than it would have been by tears	54.53934097290039

anne followed him with her eyes and as he withdrew at every step he took a disdainful smile was seen playing then gradually burst upon her lips	72.07829284667969
he listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rather frivolous adventures that the count like himself had a secret to hide in the depths of his heart	78.16268157958984
i think it does indeed cried the gascon who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at court	70.65320587158203

three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard	93.84254455566406
an officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawing-room and was advancing towards <unk> preceded by a commissary of police girded with his scarf	54.46300506591797
as far as you yourself are concerned i see but one point in which you are really guilty	73.32305908203125

d <unk> believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape drew a pistol from his belt but athos raised his hand	80.94510650634766
a thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre and masked a portion of the front around this shrubbery two alleys like two arms extended right and left and formed a <unk> from the iron gates to a double portico on every step of which stood a porcelain vase filled with flowers	66.21375274658203

many also who were not aware of the circumstances attending his withdrawal from paris were struck with the worthy appearance the gentlemanly bearing and the knowledge of the world displayed by the old patrician who certainly played the nobleman very well so long as he said nothing and made no arithmetical calculations	90.80948638916016
suddenly an idea flashed across his mind	89.37374114990234
i have heard said <unk> that port is a very good <unk> excellent exclaimed <unk> smacking his lips	62.0405387878418

d <unk> as he crossed the pont neuf congratulated himself on having found planchet again for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him nor was he sorry that through planchet and the situation which he held in rue des lombards a connection with the bourgeoisie might be commenced at that critical period when that class were preparing to make war with the court party	116.194580078125

at this sigh felton turned round	81.69239044189453

the man whom athos had come so far to seek and whom he had found with so much trouble introduced him into his laboratory where he was engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a skeleton	52.21414566040039

the next minute franz heard himself called by albert who made the lofty building <unk> with the sound of his friend s name	73.94982147216797

the host called the <unk> and ordered him to saddle <unk> <unk> then he awoke his son a child of seven years whom he ordered to ride before the gentleman and bring back the horse	76.90069580078125

but at the same moment his two auditors accompanied by the host fell upon d <unk> with sticks shovels and tongs	37.00255584716797
the old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk trimmed with steel buttons beautifully cut and polished	35.72564697265625
at the end of five minutes they perceived the carriage drawn up by the roadside a cavalier richly dressed was close to the door	23.9239559173584
however you will be better informed as to me and my possessions ere long. and the count while pronouncing these latter words accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor franz d <unk>	120.10161590576172

eug√©nie bowed coldly to the count and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured monte cristo that mademoiselle <unk> preferred to his society and to that of m. cavalcanti the company of mademoiselle louise d <unk> her singing teacher	74.699951171875

d <unk> obeyed like a child without the least resistance or objection which proved that he was really in love	51.674991607666016

why there is nothing to prove that the general was murdered	47.21013259887695
but three weeks had already passed and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of mademoiselle <unk> to the count andrea cavalcanti	59.75007247924805

whole hours sometimes passed while faria was giving instructions to dant√®s <unk> which were to serve him when he was at liberty	100.9388427734375

then he advanced but before they could meet the vessel again changed her course	139.41986083984375
athos filled a beaker with champagne and gave it to him	32.83552932739258
the king seeing that he did not reply repeated his question	42.35466003417969
then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the executioner	50.75954818725586
unfortunately he is more nimble than his master so that for the sake of his master he puts us all under his feet and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for he takes all he wants without asking at <unk> the fact is said d <unk> i have always observed a great degree of intelligence and <unk> in <unk> that is possible monsieur but suppose i should happen to be brought in contact even four times a year with such intelligence and <unk> i should be a ruined man no for porthos will pay <unk> hum said the host in a doubtful tone	69.51293182373047

in fact of the twenty <unk> which formed the <unk> not one bore the mark of the slug nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil	62.25348663330078
the cry of terror which was stopped on <unk> s lips seemed to start from his eyes	38.05662155151367
five minutes after the <unk> again appeared all eyes were fixed on the door and i said beauchamp shared the general expectation and anxiety	84.65811920166016

he remained there some time alone	121.4553451538086

athos then went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the time continued <unk> to a young b√©arnais a cadet in his majesty s guards the company of monsieur <unk> but scarcely had he arrived at his friend s and taken up a book while waiting his return when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege to the house broke open several <unk> the cardinal made the king a sign which signified that was on account of the affair about which i spoke to <unk> we all know that interrupted the king for all that was done for our <unk> then said <unk> it was also for your majesty s service that one of my musketeers who was innocent has been seized that he has been placed between two guards like a malefactor and that this gallant man who has ten times she would his blood in your majesty s service and is ready to she would it again has been paraded through the midst of an insolent populace bah said the king who began to be shaken was it so managed monsieur de <unk> said the cardinal with the greatest phlegm does not tell your majesty that this innocent musketeer this gallant man had only an hour before attacked sword in hand four commissaries of inquiry who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest <unk> i defy your eminence to prove it cried <unk> with his gascon freedom and military frankness for one hour before monsieur athos who i will confide it to your majesty is really a man of the highest quality did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in the saloon of my h√¥tel with the duc de la <unk> and the comte de <unk> who happened to be <unk> the king looked at the cardinal	97.95170593261719

i am a stranger and a stranger to such a degree that this is the first time i have ever been at paris	27.076255798339844
why to me why you killed him	67.10395812988281
the name he pronounced in a voice of tenderness amounting almost to love was that of hayd√©e	94.84388732910156
i requested him to call and when i came to the louvre i left orders if he came to desire him to <unk> let him be sent for <unk> your majesty s orders shall be executed <unk> but what but the queen will perhaps refuse to <unk> my orders yes if she is ignorant that these orders come from the <unk> well that she may have no doubt on that head i will go and inform her <unk> your majesty will not forget that i have done everything in my power to prevent a <unk> yes duke yes i know you are very indulgent toward the queen too indulgent perhaps we shall have occasion i warn you at some future period to speak of <unk> whenever it shall please your majesty but i shall be always happy and proud sire to sacrifice myself to the harmony which i desire to see reign between you and the queen of <unk> very well cardinal very well but meantime send for monsieur the keeper of the seals	71.28976440429688
signed <unk> that this record should have all due authority it shall bear the imperial seal which the vendor is bound to have affixed to <unk> near the merchant s signature there was indeed the seal of the sublime emperor	117.99055480957031
deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation	66.71192169189453
each man had stabbed him separately and intoxicated by their crime though still pale with fear they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold	143.91700744628906
this philosophic reflection thought he will make a great sensation at m. de <unk> s and he arranged mentally while dant√®s awaited further questions the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence	130.4928436279297
i had the honor of asking you why you altered your costume	54.91878890991211
i did not know when i came with such haste to you that i was to meet an enemy <unk> an enemy cried merc√©d√®s with an angry look at her cousin	47.1791877746582
who goes there cried he as soon as he perceived the horsemen	60.412628173828125
this brother was my only friend we became <unk> at five he at eighteen	215.56797790527344
midnight sounded and almost at the same time the bell was rung in milady s chamber	52.015010833740234
then <unk> feeling that he was leaving him raised himself on his elbow and with a dying voice cried with great effort murder	99.91539764404297
he will be delivered to the parliament members of which can of course be bought but even monsieur de mazarin is not rich enough to buy the whole <unk> i think returned anne of austria fixing upon him a glance which in any woman s face would have expressed disdain but in a queen s spread terror to those she looked upon nay i perceive you dare to threaten the mother of your <unk> madame replied d <unk> i threaten simply and solely because i am obliged to do so	89.90062713623047
you are monsieur d <unk> you see monsieur that you say it <unk> but i tell you monsieur commissary cried <unk> in his turn there is not the least doubt about the matter	32.810672760009766
pray d <unk> said athos after a minute either take off that ring or turn the mounting inside it recalls such cruel recollections that i shall have no head to converse with you	120.96430969238281
large rooms completely stripped of furniture bare walls upon which here and there shone the old gold moldings which had resisted time and neglect windows with broken panes impossible to close no carpets neither guards nor servants this is what first met the eyes of athos to which he touching his companion s elbow directed his attention by his glances	242.42666625976562
smuggling is a profitable trade when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed as for myself brought up in the mountains i had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and <unk> officers as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry and an inquiry always looks back into the past	152.1379852294922
i believed him still at <unk> oh sir if you know who this man is cried d <unk> tell me who he is and whence he is	51.602622985839844
well morrel let us both examine the depths of your heart	59.00816345214844
although he felt himself ably supported the young man was not without a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase step by step	64.1209945678711
then turning toward porthos the devil said he this has a bad look	68.97303009033203
if i should be killed one of you must take it and continue the route if he be killed it will be another s turn and so <unk> a single one arrives that is all that is <unk> bravo d <unk> your opinion is mine cried athos besides we must be consistent i am going to take the waters you will accompany me	52.25864791870117
monsieur de st. merri you <unk> my lord i have in my parish a man who might be of the greatest use to <unk> who and what is this man a shopkeeper in the rue des lombards who has great influence upon the commerce of his <unk> what is his name he is named planchet who himself also caused a rising about six weeks ago but as he was searched for after this <unk> he <unk> and can you find him i hope so	55.06610870361328
the accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the wood	62.18812561035156
this is where the mad abb√© was kept sir and that is where the young man entered and the guide pointed to the opening which had remained unclosed	76.65190124511719
four hundred and seventy-five livres said d <unk> who reckoned like archimedes	61.526222229003906
he is a charming fellow i allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than <unk> madame <unk> was rooted to the spot she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate	66.45697021484375
the second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the <unk> smell dant√®s was surprised not to find in the outer cavern	96.45733642578125
and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and eug√©nie appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian opera	67.35230255126953
it was the duc de beaufort who was coming from the <unk> and whom the coadjutor was showing to the parisians intoxicated with joy	29.655609130859375
the baron might possibly have perceived it but attributing it to a caprice feigned ignorance	67.95050811767578
well said franz to him there is the beginning of an <unk> laugh if you <unk> really think so	43.12474822998047
planchet went and presented himself as a lackey out of a place who was in search of a situation	62.23469924926758
the history of athos s imprisonment was then related to them and as they were really gentlemen they pronounced the host in the wrong	59.382164001464844
merc√©d√®s is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in paris replied <unk>	33.362030029296875
finally at <unk> i lost all trace of her	119.53382110595703
the apartment destined for the purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows over each of which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the name of one of the principal cities of france beneath these windows a wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house	61.849403381347656
quite sir my master has ordered his horses at eight of the clock <unk> very good replied albert that is all i wished to <unk> then turning towards beauchamp if you have anything to attend to beauchamp do it directly if you have any appointment for this evening defer it till tomorrow	60.383140563964844
he is my friend and this morning offered to share his money with me as i shared mine with him	67.349609375
all these trees great or small were turned in the direction to which the mistral blows one of the three curses of provence the others being the durance and the parliament	135.22544860839844
about this time the nurse s cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her hand	31.456361770629883
lord wilmore having heard the door close after him returned to his bedroom where with one hand he pulled off his light hair his red whiskers his false jaw and his wound to resume the black hair dark complexion and pearly teeth of the count of monte cristo	54.14342498779297
eug√©nie she said to herself is lost and so are we	160.7305145263672
around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped his energetic mind slumbered as the body does after extreme fatigue	146.87557983398438
planchet had followed the road like athos he had discovered the stains of blood like athos he had noted the spot where the horses had halted	71.80988311767578
he had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded villefort s brow because they were guilty at least he believed so but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed	115.88920593261719
he could not yet see that dreadful cross but he felt somehow as if it were coming to meet him	57.88582992553711
julie hesitated and resolved to take counsel	140.5165557861328

that evening he had a long conference with several friends and m. cavalcanti who had remained in the drawing-room with the ladies was the last to leave the banker s house	36.2213249206543
madame <unk> did not see them she was engaged in stilling the beatings of her heart and restraining the tears which were ready to gush forth	33.42975616455078
d <unk> was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of devotion	42.95542907714844
you will bet for me and those gentlemen for monsieur <unk> by this arrangement d <unk> could nudge porthos with his knee and make signs with his eyes to athos and aramis	56.34564971923828
what avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall	232.38107299804688

yes the marechal de grammont is right this will change the aspect of french affairs but i much fear it will do nothing for english even if it does not harm them	89.63284301757812
all the events we have described had taken place within a half hour	63.062774658203125
for an instant without an exclamation without a cry for help athos tried to sustain himself on the surface of the waters but the weight dragged him down he disappeared by degrees soon nothing was to be seen except his long floating hair then both men disappeared and the bubbling of the water which in its turn was soon effaced alone indicated the spot where these two had sunk	92.25761413574219
the stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty-five years but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time	65.54930877685547
<unk> what is it have you confidence in me give your orders said the three musketeers	55.856910705566406

has anyone brought a letter for me asked d <unk> eagerly	46.27064514160156
make no noise sir unless you wish me to consider you as one of the men of whom you spoke just now as cowards who take their weakness for a shield	52.98694610595703
on their side the three musketeers were much attached to their young comrade	58.877891540527344
three or four times he has said to me and certainly without the slightest premeditation at such a period i was five years old at another ten years old at another twelve and i induced by curiosity which kept me alive to these details have compared the dates and never found him inaccurate	78.86978912353516

water oh poor woman poor woman murmured athos in a broken voice	101.42638397216797
have you never experienced for anyone that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar friend though in reality it was the first time you had ever met	79.89543151855469
to save yourselves to scamper away to <unk> is good for the king s musketeers porthos and aramis trembled with rage	47.8170166015625

barrois his features convulsed his eyes suffused with blood and his head thrown back was lying at full length beating the floor with his hands while his legs had become so stiff that they looked as if they would break rather than bend	62.67082595825195

porthos and aramis regarded each other not understanding this assurance of athos	64.77775573730469
before his departure the count went to hayd√©e s apartments told her his intention and resigned everything to her care	96.06185913085938
it was necessary to be as good a horseman as he was to risk such a scheme for no sooner had the animal felt the burning tinder than he uttered a cry of pain and reared and jumped as if he had been mad	45.25046157836914
i have had no occasion to notice him particularly he is an old acquaintance	56.26357650756836

debray inquired <unk> with an air of indulgence and <unk> that made monte cristo smile acquainted as he was with the secrets of the banker s domestic life	81.1448974609375
the most dreadful misfortunes the most frightful sufferings the abandonment of all those who loved me the persecution of those who did not know me formed the trials of my youth when suddenly from captivity solitude misery i was restored to light and liberty and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant so unbounded so unheard-of that i must have been blind not to be conscious that god had endowed me with it to work out his own great designs	100.94698333740234
when you arrived madame de <unk> had already been panting for breath some minutes she then had a fit which i took to be simply a nervous attack and it was only when i saw her raise herself in the bed and her limbs and neck appear stiffened that i became really alarmed	114.67769622802734

it is a rock of almost conical form which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean	37.76765441894531
he had reflected that in a few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger who appeared to be his agent and he judged with reason he had not a moment to lose	45.42597579956055
curiosity prevailed over prudence and profiting by the preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have plunged the two personages now on the scene he stole from his hiding place and quick as lightning but stepping with utmost caution he ran and placed himself close to the angle of the wall from which his eye could pierce the interior of aramis s room	74.1140365600586

imposing silence grimaud put out the little night lamp then knelt down and poured into the lieutenant s ear a recital melodramatic enough not to require play of feature to give it pith	113.8001937866211
the gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns according to the italian custom and as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the <unk> rarest of all luxuries in their complete <unk> well understood the <unk> was loaded with <unk> and flowers	58.67760467529297

he followed with his eye each movement of teresa and her cavalier when their hands touched he felt as though he should swoon every pulse beat with violence and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears	125.81194305419922
then he raised the <unk> cautiously with his head and looked carefully around the chamber	34.60429382324219
