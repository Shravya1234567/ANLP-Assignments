my good dame asked d <unk> can you tell me what has become of one of my friends whom we were obliged to leave here about a dozen days ago a handsome young man <unk> or <unk> years old mild amiable and well made that is <unk> in the <unk> just so	61.54972457885742
he thought that there had been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom faria offered the treasures	85.48997497558594
this was a useless clause in the bargain for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of africa he runs down below and can only be induced to appear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the <unk> franz remained a moment silent and pensive hardly knowing what to think of the <unk> <unk> with which his host related the brief narrative	169.30865478515625
<unk> saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference at the same time giving a side look at valentine which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room	71.15802001953125
but i excuse it it is impossible to expect the son of a girondin to be free from a small spice of the old <unk> a deep crimson suffused the countenance of villefort	46.36617660522461
oh how distinctly i remember that kiss <unk> was the last he ever gave me and i feel as if it were still warm on my forehead	95.19889068603516
doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character	125.44503021240234
immediately replied d <unk> we have not a minute to <unk> hello grimaud	75.83807373046875
the cavalier entered the second hall which was guarded by the musketeers and doorkeepers	41.8792839050293
what a beautiful creature cried valentine why did you not bring him close to the gate so that i could talk to him and pat him he is as you see a very valuable animal said maximilian	89.39956665039062
one day when he had an appointment with a duchess he endeavored even to borrow it of athos	87.66478729248047
what the devil are you doing there cried the two friends	30.03054428100586
he immediately made a new point in advance rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves of trees and placed himself across the road about two hundred paces from the camp	55.141361236572266
yes my dear aramis we all know that your views have a religious <unk> i am only temporarily a musketeer said aramis humbly	120.99015045166016

you belong to the court doubtless yet i have never seen you at court	144.186279296875
the people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that hung over them	103.05447387695312
the paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations	76.82479858398438
then in the evening i shall go to the theatre i shall look like some retired baker	63.94658660888672

nothing was yet to be seen only they heard the galloping draw nearer	232.92166137695312
these baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit there were sicily <unk> pomegranates from malaga oranges from the balearic isles peaches from france and dates from tunis	70.20011138916016

he took a hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the pont du louvre but there he met rochefort and his fifty horsemen attended by more than five hundred men	104.7750244140625
the executioner then took off his red cloak spread it upon the ground laid the body in it threw in the head tied all up by the four corners lifted it on his back and entered the boat again	120.40087890625
they were within fifteen miles of monte cristo when the sun began to set behind corsica whose mountains appeared against the sky showing their rugged peaks in bold relief this mass of rock like the giant <unk> rose dead ahead a formidable barrier and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow	119.15737915039062
oh madame said the count when valentine had left the room was it on my account that you sent mademoiselle de villefort away by no means replied the young lady quickly but this is the hour when we usually give m. <unk> the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful existence	88.96966552734375
oh sir exclaimed he thank heaven i have arrived in time	186.2032928466797

the return to la rochelle therefore was profoundly dull	118.65304565429688
have you finished grimaud grimaud made a sign in the affirmative and pointed to a dozen bodies which he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes	42.74467849731445
in the meanwhile i am a musketeer in that quality i say what i please and at this moment it pleases me to say that you weary me. aramis porthos gentlemen	76.21094512939453
tomorrow perhaps he may change you	102.66719055175781
truth compelled franz in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count to confess that the advantage was not on <unk> s side	49.08129119873047
the prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue	34.827850341796875
oh yes i assure you count they want nothing that can render them happy they are young and cheerful they are tenderly attached to each other and with twenty-five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as <unk> <unk> thousand francs is not a large sum however replied monte cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to maximilian s heart like the voice of a father but they will not be content with that	89.34762573242188
i have sent for three of my friends but who knows whether they were at home yes yes	43.481746673583984

he was certainly eating and noisily too like an <unk> man	70.79075622558594
at present i confess that is the thing i stand most in need <unk> buckingham gave d <unk> a chamber adjoining his own	112.93262481689453

the three listeners looked at one another in alarm	52.88774108886719
d <unk> freely applying his spurs was in advance of porthos two feet at the most <unk> followed two lengths behind the guards were scattered according to the varying excellence of their respective mounts	96.20974731445312
my sister sends you this authorization with great pleasure for she is very partial to the little girl to whom she intends to be more serviceable hereafter	85.65257263183594
when he was within twenty paces of it he heard a noise of people and the carriage stopped	56.82509231567383
two of her companions were dressed the one as a woman of nettuno and the other as a woman of la <unk>	45.65005874633789
for me cried the boy his eyes sparkling with joy if i can find out where bazin is going	85.0325927734375

i will tell you all replied anne	89.22445678710938
at daybreak d <unk> entered the chamber and demanded what was to be done	52.10502243041992
silence said d <unk> taking her hand which without thinking of it she abandoned to him	80.81755828857422
these important advantages d <unk> found to his own taste in the rue <unk> at the sign of the roe	31.26255226135254
black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments then follows the melancholy chant of the priests mingled now and then with a sob of anguish escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers	155.08863830566406
now my dear <unk> i have often remarked that in addition to your courage which is indisputable and your fidelity which is invincible you possess an admirable <unk> you have found that out have you my lord	80.47554016113281
they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his coming	115.76956939697266
in three seconds d <unk> had wounded him three times exclaiming at each thrust one for athos one for porthos and one for aramis at the third hit the gentleman fell like a log	161.2275390625
i will begin again then order to conduct <unk> person named charlotte <unk> branded by the justice of the kingdom of france but liberated after chastisement	143.90054321289062

on their side the three musketeers were much attached to their young comrade	118.15541076660156
in fact he said as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission athos for generosity is a hero of romance porthos has an excellent disposition but is easily influenced aramis has a hieroglyphic countenance always illegible	143.60861206054688
oh said porthos there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coronet you promised me d <unk> bah	58.38288879394531
it was this that made me start when you said the other day at m. de <unk> s that messrs. thomson french were your bankers	71.00489044189453
how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth	21.414440155029297
the messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands	9.002581596374512
oh what a clumsy thing i am said she with feverish volubility i do not know my way	47.14225387573242
as to d <unk> he sprang toward <unk> himself	92.43925476074219
the minutes passed madame de villefort could not drop the curtain which she held like a funeral pall over the head of valentine	43.13580322265625
there caressing as he pretended the animal with his hand he put this bit of burning tinder in his ear	73.32736206054688
on opening the door villefort found himself facing him and the young magistrate s first impulse was to pause	117.93324279785156
well three days after that you talked politics with m. debray and you fancied from his words that don carlos had returned to spain	114.16548156738281
and you want my blessing he said	88.61681365966797
you must go then mademoiselle said emmanuel	84.524169921875

they then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for milady	98.18739318847656
oh said aramis i always try to be prepared and then i knew you were seeking me. from whom from master bazin to be sure he took you for the devil my dear fellow and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if i should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of <unk> oh monsieur said bazin clasping his hands <unk>	89.44690704345703

yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed but he was lost sight of at the corner of the rue de la <unk> and the rue <unk> villefort leaned on the back of an armchair for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him he breathed again	52.298683166503906
standing well at court whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch whether the government was doctrinaire liberal or conservative looked upon by all as a man of talent since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded hated by many but warmly supported by others without being really liked by anybody m. de villefort held a high position in the magistracy and maintained his eminence like a <unk> or a molé	132.1947784423828
let me have some dinner at once	84.53541564941406
i see my lord i shall be obliged to fetch a second grimaud very well let us say no more about it	60.25126647949219
villefort and madame <unk> remained for a moment as if rooted to their seats they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances	108.16111755371094

villefort rose and ran towards his mother-in-law for it was she	65.5404281616211
many also who were not aware of the circumstances attending his withdrawal from paris were struck with the worthy appearance the gentlemanly bearing and the knowledge of the world displayed by the old patrician who certainly played the nobleman very well so long as he said nothing and made no arithmetical calculations	130.92257690429688
<unk> he cried as they descended	96.06319427490234
signor luigi continued albert is there any formality to fulfil before i take leave of your excellency none sir replied the bandit you are as free as <unk> well then a happy and merry life to you	91.80315399169922
the chancellor advanced therefore toward anne of austria and said with a very perplexed and embarrassed air and now it remains for me to make the principal <unk> what is that asked the queen who did not understand or rather was not willing to understand	76.70206451416016
grimaud turned round with a jerk recognized me and pointed to the man in the mask	96.11620330810547
here he said take this <unk> do you give it to me yes but only on condition that you will not open it till i am gone and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found which was more valuable to him than the richest jewel he rushed out of the corridor and reaching his boat cried to marseilles then as he departed he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison	76.24588012695312
i am on my own ground and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall and to look over when i please without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character	97.26078796386719
the proposition had been made and received with enthusiasm when fortunately eleven of the clock struck	94.86569213867188
she cast her eyes upon the table saw the glittering of a knife rushed toward it and clutched it but her disappointment was cruel	122.09635925292969
you love me my beautiful queen and you will weep for me oh my god my god cried anne of austria this is more than i can bear	36.5178337097168
carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him	32.68312454223633
in a few minutes valentine re-entered the garden alone	163.4545135498047
unwilling to injure them by praising them too highly he replied they	173.69757080078125
do you desire it as ardently as you say <unk> well then you shall have it the young girl much astonished raised her head to look at him but his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips	74.0504150390625
it is my marriage you mean is it not dear <unk> yes yes yes signed the paralytic casting on valentine a look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning	121.7060317993164

fortunately dantès had learned how to wait he had waited fourteen years for his liberty and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth	112.88201141357422
you mean to say we <unk> <unk> said athos quietly drawing four <unk> from his pocket and throwing them upon the table	49.51726150512695
the next day they kept their word and thus they grew up together	154.17787170410156
but pride restrained him and he did not utter it	27.694591522216797
dantès turned pale hesitated and reflected	115.080322265625

a love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress dwells undoubtedly in some paternal hearts toward a son	123.51227569580078
but d <unk> was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age dressed simply but in perfect taste entered the room raising as he came his hat adorned with a long plume of scarlet feathers	114.70389556884766
it is very simple <unk> had said he is thinking of <unk> it was captain <unk> the reader will remember who had broken parry s head	91.45636749267578

d <unk> employed himself in arranging a little plan of which we shall hereafter see the execution and which promised him some agreeable adventure as might be seen by the smiles which from time to time passed over his countenance whose thoughtfulness they animated	111.14974975585938
at first indeed they were doubtful whether the king s visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten or increase their burdens but scarcely was it known that the taxes were to be still further increased when cries of down with mazarin long live <unk> long live <unk> resounded through the city	161.2831268310547

yet man will never be perfect until he learns to create and destroy he does know how to destroy and that is half the <unk> so added madame de villefort constantly returning to her object the poisons of the borgias the medicis the <unk> the <unk> and later probably that of baron de trenck whose story has been so misused by modern drama and <unk> were objects of art madame and nothing more replied the count	140.21649169921875

on one of those immense staircases upon whose space modern civilization would build a whole house ascended and descended the office seekers of paris who ran after any sort of <unk> from the provinces anxious to be enrolled and servants in all sorts of liveries bringing and carrying messages between their masters and m. de <unk>	140.06968688964844
at this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards them	74.14376068115234
my own conscience and your politeness sir are the guarantees of <unk> however flattering this compliment the officer made no reply but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle such as <unk> use in ships of war he whistled three times with three different modulations	147.37066650390625

here he is d <unk> walking and <unk> had arrived within a few steps of the hôtel d <unk> and in front of that hôtel perceived aramis chatting gaily with three gentlemen but as he had not forgotten that it was in presence of this young man that m. de <unk> had been so angry in the morning and as a witness of the rebuke the musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable he pretended not to see him	65.38978576660156
it was thought rather dear but people wanted to sleep and who would not give even two or three louis for a few hours of sound sleep	137.80030822753906
at this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening dantès seized his gun sprang through the opening and mounted the stair	111.02071380615234
at length one evening as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night dantès with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones	93.99610900878906

i say that you must surrender your sword to me monsieur and that without resistance	129.65248107910156
d <unk> passed the day in exhibiting his musketeer s uniform in every street of the camp	113.24748992919922
this door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in the courtyard ready to obey the orders of the prince de conti s lieutenant	34.120731353759766
he took back the ring but put it in his pocket and not on his finger	48.29311752319336
he had half guessed what was going on when he saw franz quit the cemetery with m. de villefort	55.482757568359375

during this time he occupied himself in making figures with his watch by his side	92.84349822998047
villefort looked disdainfully at morrel and replied coldly you are aware monsieur that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life and the best seaman in the merchant service and yet be politically speaking a great criminal	181.1894989013672
he found his carriage at the door and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find beauchamp who was in his office	49.26039505004883
d <unk> was worn out with fatigue	43.260772705078125

that is the least we owe <unk> that is true said athos but that concerns <unk> well replied the latter blushing what must i say oh that is simple enough replied athos	61.998722076416016

d <unk> and planchet had hardly turned the corner when porthos recognized them	241.66136169433594
at this moment a horse without a rider covered with foam his nostrils extended and eyes all fire galloped up and recognizing his master stopped and <unk> with pleasure it was arthur	160.0915069580078
i had sworn to die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges but now that this ornament may be useful to him or his defenders everything must be sacrificed	130.04403686523438

in order to go from the door to the house or from the house to the door m. de villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees	30.94637107849121

franz had been to announce the ceremony and madame de villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him the death of m. de <unk> and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every happiness	98.310791015625

as to haydée these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment for she ceased speaking her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm and her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the pindus and the blue waters of the lake of yanina which like a magic mirror seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched	95.15676879882812

your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of diana the huntress and yet you are not <unk> no for that very resemblance <unk> me i should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or capua but this <unk> diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of <unk> and indeed it required but one glance at mademoiselle <unk> to comprehend the justness of <unk> s remark	124.56803131103516
do you think it is worth while said villefort	55.080657958984375

one may soon see that you are a soldier	24.10489845275879
d <unk> made a spring backward and drew his sword	44.738006591796875
albert could not see the face of the countess as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head and which fell over her features in misty folds but it seemed to him as though her voice had altered	71.33322143554688
and you will tell him i will publish the report of <unk> and the marquis de <unk> upon the interview which the duke had at the residence of madame the constable with the queen on the evening madame the constable gave a masquerade	44.061038970947266

he took a seat and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary	63.7627067565918
it is evident by their sending for me that matters are becoming complicated	398.0816650390625

this done he impatiently awaited the return of his companions	53.736473083496094
taste the hashish guest of <unk> the <unk> franz s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation about as much in quantity as his host had eaten and lift it to his mouth	115.64167022705078
this duet is one of the most beautiful expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of donizetti	59.27643966674805
porthos effaced himself against the wall but he could not render himself invisible and the man in the cloak said to him giving him his lantern light the lamp which hangs from the <unk> then addressing d <unk> you know the watchword he said	64.0126724243164

this was a very easy matter for a woman so really superior as she was	113.09407806396484
in an instant he was placed in the <unk> of the boat between the gendarmes while the officer stationed himself at the bow a shove sent the boat adrift and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the pilon	62.849666595458984
those gilded <unk> drawers locked like gates of fortresses heaps of <unk> come from i know not where and the quantities of letters from england holland spain india china and peru have generally a strange influence on a father s mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents	118.92549896240234
it is a very strong post he resumed and we have forty good men tried soldiers having no connection with <unk> nor any interest in the <unk> if we put these three men together monsieur comminges said mazarin we must double the guard and we are not rich enough in fighting men to commit such acts of <unk> comminges smiled mazarin read and construed that smile	178.22186279296875

how could i pronounce that word	74.18592071533203
nevertheless after several attempts at conversation with <unk> he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull and the count s agreeable voice his gentle and persuasive eloquence recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from athos the most amusing and the best informed of guides	126.77863311767578
the gascon therefore instead of answering growled out ja	42.61948013305664
mercédès raised her head and uttered a cry of terror on beholding a man before her	46.94108200073242

at all events if you want me remember the rue <unk> hotel de la <unk> and i shall be at the convent of jesuits from six in the morning to eight at night come by the door	48.45583724975586
i am still terrified to such a degree that i scarcely believe my eyes	64.23367309570312
it was the same through which twenty-four years ago he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard the houses today so smiling and animated were on that night dark mute and closed	243.5921630859375
when d <unk> arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the monastery athos had been waiting about five minutes and twelve of the clock was striking	52.287010192871094
at the other end of the room under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse still more alarming to morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard	89.65306091308594
she had laid that down the preceding evening	81.75325012207031
then those who dwelt in <unk> s unfortunate house together with the nearest neighbors heard loud cries stamping of feet clashing of swords and breaking of furniture	198.3612060546875
d <unk> reassured her as well as he could and promised to remain insensible to the seductions of milady	52.420997619628906
why the good god sends him back <unk> <unk> sank pale and breathless into his chair	56.94843292236328
franz had as yet found nothing to say he had come to no determination and as nothing in the count s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more proof besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum	74.86676788330078
now gascons are always poor are they not sire i can assert that they have hitherto discovered no gold mines in their mountains though the lord owes them this miracle in recompense for the manner in which they supported the pretensions of the king your <unk> which is to say that the gascons made a king of me myself seeing that i am my father s son is it not <unk>	109.33509826660156
you had your secret and we had ours we did not exchange them	133.0604248046875
the young man turned round thinking that <unk> or monte cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were starting	98.05975341796875
provisions began to fail and whenever one of the prince de conti s generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult which he put down again and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his colleagues	98.86032104492188
<unk> oh villefort villefort murmured the count this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hours do you wish to see anything more sir said the concierge	100.65660858154297
is he not peculiar he is more than that replied <unk> he is one of the most extraordinary men i ever saw in my life	55.321449279785156
and madame de villefort have just left this room have they not <unk> and it was they who told you something which made you angry	171.38218688964844
he had the resolution to stop with this	63.67586898803711
the dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself with the deepest respect at the feet of monsieur de <unk> who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud but a frown succeeded and he bit his lips with vexation	113.72727966308594
can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the piazza del popolo ah said the count negligently looking attentively at <unk> is there not something like an execution upon the piazza del popolo yes returned franz finding that the count was coming to the point he wished	67.2271957397461
the duke was in the act of combing his beard which he had allowed to grow as well as his hair in order to reproach mazarin with his wretched appearance and condition	82.85482025146484
ah cursed gascon that i am i get from one hobble into another	107.43157958984375
well cried he with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world my cavalier has attained his object	113.58679962158203
the <unk> never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times ineffectually like the soldier who beheaded the count of chalais and to whose tender mercy richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer	201.10751342773438
and he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabbard	59.4018440246582
but since the end of the month m. morrel had passed many an anxious hour	83.44407653808594
so so said he in a hoarse and choking voice to <unk> this then i suppose is a part of the trick you were <unk> yesterday	78.95720672607422
<unk> had flattered himself in believing himself worthy of st. paul or of the place de <unk> it was at the traitor s cross that his journey and his destiny were about to end	101.4411849975586
what are you doing reverend sir	110.31291198730469
special rules set forth in the general terms of use part of this license apply to copying and distributing project <unk> electronic works to protect the project <unk> concept and trademark	52.97957992553711
in the year 1811 i was transferred to piedmont in france	34.828792572021484
in his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart	84.23077392578125
he remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest windows of the tower	37.067474365234375
monsieur du vallon and i are the only two who are armed	114.97724914550781
when landing at portsmouth milady was an englishwoman whom the persecutions of the french drove from la rochelle when landing at boulogne after a two days passage she passed for a frenchwoman whom the english persecuted at portsmouth out of their hatred for france	151.10008239746094
there will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars for there before my eyes beneath my feet all around me i have the plan sketched with all the living reality of <unk> after making the tour of the garden a second time the count re-entered his carriage while <unk> who perceived the thoughtful expression of his master s features took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word	98.03894805908203
villefort s first impression was favorable but he had been so often warned to mistrust first impulses that he applied the maxim to the impression forgetting the difference between the two words	104.52377319335938
la <unk> was in ecstasies at having beaten a prince of the blood	66.16407775878906
hearing the noise of the fight resumed the duke i fancied you had about twenty men with you so i came back with those around me tired of always running away and wishing to draw my sword in my own because but you are only <unk> yes my lord but as you have said two that are a match for twenty said athos	112.58973693847656
a slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed athos of the gascon s uneasiness	148.74224853515625
oh no monsieur replied monte cristo i do not thus betray my enjoyments to the vulgar	57.24757385253906
the rapidity of his walk heated his blood still more the idea that he left behind him exposed to a frightful vengeance the woman he loved or rather whom he adored as a saint the emotion he had experienced present <unk> together exalted his mind above human feeling	287.52581787109375
without communicating his thoughts to his companion he sat down drew out his <unk> and looked another way	56.16893005371094
oh yes tired <unk> has done nothing the whole of this blessed day	142.08522033691406
the old man who had preserved all his usual coolness made a sign to him to do so	40.97153091430664
tomorrow i will see you again to take my <unk> with these words the baron went out	36.9795036315918
he only felt one uneasiness and that was at not hearing any tidings from his friends	171.0187530517578
is it my fault if fortune which has frowned on you has been kind to me fortune has been kind to you then	163.4038543701172
now i am alone my dear athos said d <unk> open the door i beg of <unk> instantly said athos	42.50563430786133
the executioner who had lifted himself up fell back upon his bed	69.22968292236328
what time is it then eh	236.32986450195312
then albert launched out in praise of mademoiselle <unk> voice and on his regret after what he had just heard that he had been unable to be present the previous evening	60.91630172729492
certainly i excuse you said monte cristo graciously and pocket <unk> and he placed the bonds in his <unk>	47.333656311035156
on his part the king returned to his apartment	43.00774383544922
there said d <unk> we can not be overtaken	30.800525665283203
thank him then madame if you have any affection for me. milady frowned slightly a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow and so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man who saw and observed this triple shade almost shuddered at it	133.44216918945312
i pity her <unk> and you have reason for she is much to be pitied	55.28679656982422
am i or am i not the queen	65.23963928222656
the change that had come over villefort during the examination the destruction of the letter the exacted promise the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment <unk> returned with a stunning force to his memory	174.24069213867188
therefore <unk> alone fell from his horse not because he was severely wounded but not being able to see the wound he judged it to be more serious than it really was	83.31121063232422
oh i can not tell what she says to me	46.88730239868164
in an instant all five were ready	345.009765625
oh it is not yet fixed murmured fernand	769.4005737304688
age has warmed not chilled your blood	108.98542022705078
was struck with this insistence and began to fancy that this recommendation concealed some mystery	187.74050903320312
wait wait you are going to know me	32.08664321899414
not so bad yet replied athos for by this time she must have quit the shores of <unk> d <unk> breathed again	60.09305953979492
from the time of his arrival in paris he had been mixed up with public affairs but his own private affairs had made no great progress either in love or fortune	124.6400375366211
the queen my sister is no longer queen my child	113.18740844726562
so far as i can judge i suppose this to be a quarter of my father s <unk> i said <unk> have always intended giving my daughter 500,000 francs as her dowry she is besides my sole <unk> all would then be easily arranged if the baroness and her daughter are willing	123.91387939453125
d <unk> more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the abbé d <unk> which contrasted so strongly with those of the musketeer aramis remained staring with wide-open eyes at the face of his friend	58.363651275634766
sir said the cardinal you have heard me	20.869686126708984
you hear comminges said the queen	7.455577373504639
for the present i will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the baroness <unk> my impatience my dear count but a client like you is almost like a member of the <unk> monte cristo bowed in sign that he accepted the proffered honor <unk> rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery	108.86882019042969
you will kill yourself cried planchet	51.723331451416016
monsieur <unk> especially i could never get such a man as that	78.12091827392578
ten times as i told you he came to see dantès father and offered to receive him in his own house and the night or two before his death as i have already said he left his purse on the mantelpiece with which they paid the old man s debts and buried him decently and so edmond s father died as he had lived without doing harm to anyone	93.90843963623047
now said the old man aid me to bury my <unk> carlini fetched two pickaxes and the father and the lover began to dig at the foot of a huge oak beneath which the young girl was to repose	57.99545669555664
you are not an enemy of our holy faith said she <unk>	106.38318634033203
at nine of the clock tomorrow rita s father will be here with the <unk> it is well in the meantime we will have a merry night this young girl is charming and does credit to your taste	65.50956726074219
<unk> asked leave to retire he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm which his sagacity had foreseen	98.19043731689453
planchet who had been the first to enter was the last to leave	68.89883422851562
come said d <unk> all this leads to nothing	246.99191284179688
the soldier replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual to whom he was talking sat	63.834228515625
athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an audience of anne of austria	52.825172424316406
come let us talk a little about my <unk> who then am i you sir <unk> are my adopted father	185.2770538330078
and you too my poor monsieur <unk> are out of place in this poor hotel are you not asked d <unk> in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or mockery	105.26924896240234
perhaps i shall stand in need of a back door for <unk> you think of <unk> and you forget one <unk> what to ask me if i want <unk> that is true	58.88111877441406
god will help <unk> gentlemen in the name of heaven said the wounded man collecting all his forces as if to get up let us not lose time in useless words	89.99816131591797
fearing however to make use of any valuable piece of paper i hesitated for a moment then recollected that i had seen in the famous breviary which was on the table beside me an old paper quite yellow with age and which had served as a marker for centuries kept there by the request of the heirs	99.1233901977539
that is it said the duke now make me a little hole in the floor whilst i go and fetch the <unk> la <unk> knelt down and made a hole in the floor meanwhile the duke hung the crawfish up by a thread	82.4622573852539
they lifted him off at the door of a cabaret left bazin with him who besides in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at amiens	111.4400405883789
athos still within the inclosure of the window watched this scene with a smile of disdain on his lips	33.46343231201172
we know the count s vigorous and daring mind denying anything to be impossible with that energy which marks the great man	106.60519409179688
unfortunately the qualities of this horse were so well concealed under his <unk> hide and his unaccountable gait that at a time when everybody was a connoisseur in horseflesh the appearance of the aforesaid pony at <unk> place he had entered about a quarter of an hour before by the gate of <unk> an unfavorable feeling which extended to his rider	98.70408630371094
i have but exchanged with him one look yet that look convinced me that we were <unk> the truth is i am very sorry that i did not strangle him as you advised me said porthos	59.469268798828125
well my dear friend win <unk> is at the point of your sword	44.4561882019043
ja replied the gascon determined to confine himself to this specimen of the german tongue	109.32321166992188
then he descended with cautious and slow step for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality	228.8892059326172
my dear friend exclaimed athos how i should admire the resources of your mind did i not stop to adore those of your <unk> and he gave him his hand	57.740577697753906
d <unk> refused but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into money	107.76718139648438
then d <unk> disposed to become the most tender of lovers was at the same time a very devoted friend	64.98311614990234
and instantly grimaud sitting upon the board as if on horseback commenced his perilous descent	90.68024444580078
aramis returned soon with a man from the hotel de rohan who was saying to him you swear sir that it is not so stop and aramis gave him a louis d or	79.83853912353516
but he knows it all now interrupted <unk> they say the dead know <unk> there was a brief silence the abbé rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his seat	119.07398986816406
doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes for the jailer said come are you going mad again dantès did not answer he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him	68.26171875
it was estimated at fifty thousand <unk> bless me exclaimed <unk> fifty thousand francs	64.13658905029297
oh yes yes this instant i entreat <unk> in a moment that part of the floor on which dantès was resting his two hands as he knelt with his head in the opening suddenly gave way he drew back smartly while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed	112.64070129394531
only name to me the base man that has brought tears into your beautiful eyes who told you that i had been weeping said she	140.18975830078125
albert however hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and <unk> during the carnival knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation	131.27308654785156
do not give yourself the trouble my lord said d <unk> with his right foot forward his beaver in his hand a smile on his face we have followed your eminence step by step and here we <unk> <unk> we are said porthos	52.6645393371582
but do you happen to belong to him monsieur d <unk> replied athos is in the service he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional authority	49.9042854309082
perhaps you had a spy at your heels and your visit if it should ever be known to the cardinal will thus seem <unk> d <unk> drew up his request and m. de <unk> on receiving it assured him that by two of the clock in the morning the four leaves of absence should be at the respective domiciles of the travelers	62.278873443603516
speak it is this when we escape together that i shall go everywhere and be always first for if my lord should be overtaken and caught there is every chance of his being brought back to prison whereas if i am caught the least that can befall me is to <unk> true on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost <unk> now resumed grimaud i have only one thing more to <unk> your highness will continue to detest me. i will try said the duke	115.62982177734375
villefort drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the house	92.79012298583984
many small donations 1 to 5,000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs	16.226226806640625
grimaud showed his master his forefinger bent	97.25183868408203

impious task cried milady with the exultation of a victim who provokes his judge	36.56882858276367
from time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from peppino	135.77645874023438
the count is fond of travelling and being rich possesses a vessel of his own	148.16567993164062
you will be deceived just the same said athos who was an optimist when things were concerned and a pessimist when men were in question	144.7661895751953
why did not the baron come himself demanded buckingham	480.0977783203125
the king is either a king or no king if he be acknowledged as sovereign of france he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at <unk> is the best and surest means of preventing <unk> unfortunately madame answered villefort the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken <unk> then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair <unk> nay madame the law is frequently powerless to effect this all it can do is to avenge the wrong <unk> oh m. de villefort cried a beautiful young creature daughter to the comte de <unk> and the cherished friend of mademoiselle de <unk> do try and get up some famous trial while we are at marseilles	143.63345336914062

he raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out saw the monk and fell back upon the litter his face illumined by joy	79.89402770996094

morrel said the count to him at length do you repent having followed me no count but to leave <unk> if i thought happiness might await you in paris morrel i would have left you <unk> valentine reposes within the walls of paris and to leave paris is like losing her a second <unk> maximilian said the count the friends that we have lost do not repose in the bosom of the earth but are buried deep in our hearts and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by them	124.51897430419922

d <unk> pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms	33.96011734008789
on looking around him however as he could perceive no threatening object as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger as the bench was comfortably covered with a <unk> cushion as the wall was ornamented with a beautiful cordova leather and as large red damask curtains fastened back by gold clasps floated before the window he perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated and he began to turn his head to the right and the left upward and downward	113.0209732055664
i went up to him as he was singing a love ditty and looking tenderly at a lady and interrupted him exactly in the middle of the second couplet	91.55497741699219

sir said d <unk> you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coachman	114.03604888916016
albert s lips scarcely whispered good-bye but his look was more explicit it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger proud disdain and generous indignation	424.6659851074219
if at this moment the sweet voice of renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair mercédès had entered and said in the name of god i conjure you to restore me my affianced husband his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber and the door was opened only by villefort s valet who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness	111.93772888183594
the hangings were of damask the carpets from alencon and the bed especially had more the look of a fine lady s couch with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered counterpane than that of a man who had made a vow that he would endeavor to gain heaven by fasting and mortification	98.02394104003906

m. de <unk> listened to the young man s account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love affair	62.22835159301758
it was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all	68.8398208618164
at the moment <unk> quitted his <unk> watch before the door the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely as a desert at midday	168.81118774414062
and were he able he would rather tear him to pieces with his teeth and nails than let him enjoy the life he himself is about to be deprived of	133.9047393798828

m. de villefort went to the door which he closed behind the child and bolted	53.306129455566406

dost know where porthos is <unk> at <unk> and aramis not in the <unk> the devil	37.57219696044922
morrel passed his hand over his brow it seemed to him a dream	30.2391357421875
it was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother unwilling to part from her son and yet aware that a young man of the viscount s age required the full exercise of his liberty had chosen this habitation for albert	109.62268829345703
he is <unk> but where is he	73.3048095703125
the door opened and a dim light reached dantès eyes through the coarse sack that covered him he saw two shadows approach his bed a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand	144.03839111328125
does this man know your majesty personally inquired aramis	140.94436645507812

shall two members of the house be sent to yanina	73.56548309326172
but at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at it	82.39791107177734
as for the world it is a sepulcher and nothing <unk> the devil	33.37360382080078
he had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board and as his orders were always clear distinct and easy of execution his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure	146.7864532470703
these two instantly mounted the coachman of the latter replacing d <unk> on the <unk> of the royal coach	72.31782531738281
does that satisfy you said athos to his adversary	24.651988983154297
is it possible that you can see anything more than the merest chance in this meeting	54.711910247802734
the repast was carried into effect that very day and the lackey waited at table	159.99795532226562
in a few minutes porthos had rejoined his companions who were already in the boat but when after they had all got in it came to his turn there was great danger that in putting his huge leg over the edge of the boat he would upset the little vessel	95.4751968383789
<unk> if you succeed with him i pronounce you the demon <unk> he went toward the door and opened it hastily	44.33037185668945
to any one not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal condition but to his <unk> athos and <unk> apparent a certain <unk> in his <unk>	60.60871887207031
am i allowed to repeat it yes but cautiously tell one thing at a time and do not say i told <unk> why so because it is a secret just <unk> by whom the <unk> then the news <unk> at the prefect s last night	95.98892211914062
but at the street gate porthos was talking with the soldier on guard	114.33316802978516
i did not mention that because the signature seemed to me so <unk> the letter signed sinbad the sailor is it not exactly so	70.81053924560547
valentine instinctively raised her eyes as if to thank heaven	59.53605651855469
i know it well i have studied it in all its forms and in the effects which it produces	82.30728149414062
how comes it that having both a sister and an adopted son you have never spoken to me of either <unk> alas i have still to recount the most distressing period of my life	103.77477264404297
and the count pressed her hand in reply as he had done eleven years before on the staircase leading to morrel s study	58.44625473022461
it is i shouted a voice	21.812393188476562
athos went toward the house while the mendicant who had received his reward left as fast as his legs could carry him	74.20902252197266
it was done on purpose for <unk> am sure of <unk> sir said the baroness humbly are you not aware that the man employed there was dismissed that they talked of going to law with him that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight which proves that he was either mad or guilty	87.25704193115234
well never mind that neighbor <unk> it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as that	64.07511901855469
shall i open the <unk> asked valentine	64.77161407470703
in twenty minutes they were at auteuil the steward s emotion had continued to augment as they entered the village	111.67345428466797
milady <unk> received d <unk> ceremoniously	10.93620777130127
maillard began the curate this gentleman and i have come to talk with you a <unk> with me said the mendicant it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy <unk> there was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which astonished the coadjutor	59.22895050048828
let us see the ground floor said <unk>	70.67217254638672
you have seven martlets on your arms give three to your wife and you will still have four that is one more than m. de guise had who so nearly became king of france and whose cousin was emperor of <unk> on my word i think you are right lucien said albert absently	126.17945098876953
after finishing that calculation i had a minute s hope	84.73174285888672
he was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and loud	89.73800659179688

in the name of heaven explain yourself oh	208.78964233398438
grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man for seeing that they continued to advance toward the <unk> he had till then <unk> pulled his master by the skirt of his coat	48.541404724121094
then they undressed him as they had done the first laid him on their bed and bound him with the straps which composed the <unk> bedstead being of oak	98.06756591796875
her hands are icy cold cried d <unk>	30.75963592529297
athos made a sign to porthos and aramis also to remain in the rear and advanced alone	45.02573776245117
as for porthos he dreamed that the panels of his carriage were not capacious enough to contain the armorial bearings he had ordered to be painted on them	55.28605651855469
beauchamp took the paper and read the article to which albert pointed in an undertone	45.99027633666992
oh god be praised he said it is a real bed this was the second time within the hour that he had invoked the name of god	58.682674407958984
alas he said i am then to die	49.25954055786133
then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which i paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either kill or <unk> it is very strange said albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage and one needs constantly to be saying to one s self this is no fiction it is all reality in order to believe it	89.09070587158203
pray was not monsieur d <unk> in the time of the cardinal mixed up in some intrigue from which he came out according to report quite cleverly my lord as to the report you allude to <unk> perceived that the cardinal wished to make him speak <unk> i know nothing but what the public knows	68.12384796142578
albert ran to fetch a carriage	41.78724670410156
the deed if you please mr. <unk> and he signed it rapidly after having first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the names of the proprietors	68.94218444824219
juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than aramis about it	105.1351089477539
he followed with his eye each movement of teresa and her cavalier when their hands touched he felt as though he should swoon every pulse beat with violence and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears	163.9957733154297
go gentlemen he said you must be much fatigued after your voyage	93.63214874267578
he knew the king of old and he knew that all these complaints were but a <unk> sort of excitation to encourage <unk> that he had now come to his point at last	85.11209869384766
he must be the shah of persia travelling <unk> have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman m. lucien inquired eugénie	106.78595733642578

there said the king looking at a clock there now as it is half past eight you may retire for as i told you i expect someone at nine	108.99066925048828
numberless groups paraded the streets and whatever d <unk> might think of it it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance in order to assume a warlike aspect	76.59880828857422
if the league which threatened france triumphed all his influence would be lost	154.9124298095703

this last proof instead of giving him fresh strength deprived him of it the pickaxe descended or rather fell he placed it on the ground passed his hand over his brow and remounted the stairs alleging to himself as an excuse a desire to be assured that no one was watching him but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint	76.20808410644531
at the end of a quarter of an hour m. d <unk> returned with his associate they found the outer gate closed and not a servant remaining in the house villefort himself was obliged to open to them	69.57471466064453
we on our side do the same	84.75526428222656
my mother pressed me to her throbbing heart and at the distance of a few paces i saw my father who was glancing anxiously around	50.496864318847656
thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate his history his terrible story is recited in the <unk> and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be swallowed by the <unk> then the count added aloud was his name ever known oh yes but only as no	105.05889129638672

totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman aided by a powerful <unk> but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own thoughts that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass	159.40806579589844
if i had had a single ornament left i should have bought wood this winter to make a fire for my daughter and <unk> oh madame said mazarin your majesty knows not what you ask	122.48285675048828
the two soldiers who had brought him in took him each by one arm and led him toward the door whilst the prince turning to marshal de grammont seemed to have already forgotten the order he had given	72.3859634399414
but though he held the cardinal s promises as of little worth he affected to be completely satisfied for he was unwilling to discourage porthos	130.2812042236328
an overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury	98.79713439941406
it was a superb moonlight night	864.9506225585938
the white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead and her eyes already sunken by the furrows of age now almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief	107.17742919921875
he was in bed but surrounded with all the paraphernalia of war	67.6366195678711
yes indeed i have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches which would make the wealth of a dozen families will be forever lost to those men who persecute me	94.62903594970703
give him some more wine <unk> fernand filled <unk> s glass who like the confirmed <unk> he was lifted his hand from the paper and seized the glass	141.989990234375
then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him put the black cravat and blue <unk> at the bottom of the portmanteau threw the hat into a dark closet broke the cane into small bits and flung it in the fire put on his <unk> and calling his valet checked with a look the thousand questions he was ready to ask paid his bill sprang into his carriage which was ready learned at lyons that bonaparte had entered grenoble and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road at length reached marseilles a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its first successes	106.66326141357422
a rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does a hypocrite does not she would the tears of a man of good faith	82.05745697021484
the host remained standing in front of him looking with a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face combining both gravity and sweetness of expression	90.45718383789062
and the other one demanded the count	61.88347625732422
at the expiration of an hour edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder	40.61919403076172
this letter was from my brother	31.38872528076172
in a few minutes laporte was at the lodge in two words d <unk> informed him where mme	121.17652130126953
franz who had mutely interrogated the countess and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome sought not to retard the gratification of albert s eager impatience but began at once the tour of the house closely followed by albert who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar and to arrange the lappets of his coat	83.69612884521484
in the meantime follow me. the cardinal alighted the three musketeers did likewise	94.64311981201172
we are compelled to admit to our readers that d <unk> thought nothing about him in any way or that if he did think of him it was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was wherever it might be	51.896060943603516
at this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river	34.99209213256836
the captain of the musketeers was therefore admired feared and loved and this constitutes the zenith of human fortune	140.16355895996094
but d <unk> still keeping on the defensive drew near to kitty s door	133.82156372070312
i fancy i perceive around us faces of different officers in the royal army is not that the duc de chatillon himself coming toward us with his brigadiers <unk> sirs said the duke advancing you are puzzled by what you see here but one word will explain everything	124.5661849975586
it was not difficult to conquer as she had hitherto done men prompt to let themselves be seduced and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her net	204.9769287109375
besides you must have something on the panels of your carriage to escape being searched by the <unk> officers	64.36296844482422
this battle of folly and flame continued for two hours the corso was light as day the features of the spectators on the third and fourth stories were visible	121.88240814208984
oh my king <unk> that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant <unk> just so madame replied chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this affirmation	108.3050537109375
the count received him with his habitual smile	16.639041900634766
the absence of grimaud whose name had never once been uttered by athos gave d <unk> uneasiness	119.77236938476562
you are thoughtful sir continued morrel you want something shall i call one of the servants yes replied <unk>	115.3188247680664
he would not listen put his foot on the spur to get down the spur broke he fell with a broken leg and instead of keeping quiet took to crying out like a <unk>	126.50664520263672
the breakfast at m. de <unk> s was as gay and cheerful as possible	52.482173919677734
it was then in the neighborhood of noyon that he must seek that estate	84.49845886230469
nothing of all this escaped grimaud but la <unk> looked on with the curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea concerning a new toy for his children	107.93946838378906
faith said aramis laughing we have praised the dead enough let us revile the living a little i should like to say something evil of mazarin is it permissible go on go on replied d <unk> laughing heartily relate your story and i will applaud it if it is a good <unk> a great prince said aramis with whom mazarin sought an alliance was invited by him to send him a list of the conditions on which he would do him the honor to negotiate with him	84.77774047851562
although the coadjutor had preached that same morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the fronde and mazarin in requesting the archbishop of paris to make his nephew preach had evidently had the intention of administering to monsieur de retz one of those italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving	93.25347137451172
my god i am dying and the duke swooned	34.03727722167969

yes monsieur we are cousins said porthos without being disconcerted as he had never reckoned upon being received enthusiastically by the husband	81.27687072753906
the fire crackled and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano but still no prisoner fell down as they expected	122.72505950927734
he invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of september <unk> unluckily as i was then in bearn on account of my father s death the letter followed me there	74.99410247802734
as he passed the table on which the axe was laid he stopped and turning with a smile said ah	79.75813293457031
it seems however that i have unconsciously stumbled upon the <unk> still argued <unk> i would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened or at least that i had had no hand in it	78.27838134765625
the travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next day the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed rest	107.78912353515625

they will promise everything for the sake of the money and on the road fear will prevent them from acting	66.3924789428711
athos slowly raised his pistol stretched out his arm so that the weapon almost touched milady s forehead and then in a voice the more terrible from having the supreme calmness of a fixed resolution madame said he you will this instant deliver to me the paper the cardinal signed or upon my soul i will blow your brains <unk> with another man milady might have preserved some doubt but she knew athos	143.77146911621094

therefore d <unk> was going to ask leave of absence of m. de <unk> confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for paris with an escort of twenty musketeers and that they formed part of the escort	57.093467712402344
all faithful hearts with me cried out winter	175.8043212890625
he remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to breathe	119.1895980834961
at the same time porthos and his adversary fired on each other and d <unk> turned to him	72.92726135253906
athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the sea	105.01040649414062
if that were so he was indeed a highly favored prince	269.0120544433594
then they began to pass around the dusky piquant <unk> sausages and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses prawns of large size and brilliant color the <unk> with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within the clovis esteemed by the epicures of the south as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster north	107.40484619140625

d <unk> suggested that he should send word to his wife so that she might not be anxious about him but planchet replied with much sagacity that he was very sure his wife would not die of anxiety through not knowing where he was while he planchet remembering her incontinence of tongue would die of anxiety if she did know	140.48573303222656
i pardon you and i weep for you	28.1810302734375
immediately the aldermen clothed in their cloth robes and preceded by six sergeants each holding a <unk> in his hand went to attend upon the king whom they met on the steps where the provost of the merchants made him the speech of <unk> compliment to which his majesty replied with an apology for coming so late laying the blame upon the cardinal who had detained him till eleven of the clock talking of affairs of state	88.08921813964844

as soon as the escort arrived in a city when they had conducted the king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to some secluded cabaret where they neither drank nor played they only conversed in a low voice looking around attentively to see that no one overheard them	123.92788696289062

madame de villefort who was alone in her drawing-room when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count and edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say oh that naughty child	132.7349395751953

not only was the first gendarme still there but the young man now perceived a second yellow blue and white uniform at the foot of the staircase the only one by which he could descend while a third on horseback holding a musket in his fist was posted as a sentinel at the great <unk> which alone afforded the means of egress	95.33812713623047
it may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the <unk> the subordinate and the master	78.43276977539062

yes you are at once from provence and spain that explains if the portrait you showed me be like the dark hue i so much admired on the visage of the noble <unk> it would have required the penetration of <unk> or the sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words apparently uttered with the greatest politeness	98.60482788085938
why in the first place his yacht is not a ship but a bird and he would beat any frigate three knots in every nine and if he were to throw himself on the coast why is he not certain of finding friends everywhere it was perfectly clear that the signor sinbad franz s host had the honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the whole coast of the mediterranean and so enjoyed exceptional privileges	94.1310806274414
it was evident he had his orders	24.308624267578125

porthos fired the flash threw a gleam of light over the field of battle	49.853790283203125
i want to <unk> everything said the abbé	25.079465866088867

do not lull yourself in security or you will be lost but on the <unk> it is i who say <unk> enemies in all directions	70.45598602294922
the count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face	72.47199249267578
but perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses my dear love pray do not say any more about them and i promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and <unk> the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this <unk> gesture turned towards monte cristo and said upon my word count i am quite sorry not to have met you sooner	98.706298828125
i will no longer detain you m. de villefort for you must be fatigued after so long a journey go and rest	112.89154052734375
he soon felt that his ideas became again <unk> could think and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning	206.2342071533203

suddenly <unk> uttered a cry of delight taking from beneath one of the benches a bottle of wine and on looking more closely in the same place he discovered a dozen similar bottles bread and a monster junk of salted beef	59.55832290649414
a little better <unk> will you drink some of this ether and water i will try but do not touch me. why not because i feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your finger the fit would <unk> <unk> barrois took the glass and raising it to his purple lips took about half of the liquid offered him	92.74345397949219
when the soldier saluted charles athos s heart bounded for joy and that unfortunate on coming to himself found ten guineas that the french gentleman had slipped into his pocket	213.61306762695312
as the distance increased between the travellers and paris almost superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count he might have been taken for an exile about to revisit his native land	103.49645233154297
ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three musketeers to halt	31.793363571166992
there he stopped breathless and panting	27.884544372558594
both as this double precaution indicated had an interest in not being recognized	387.6513671875
you ask me why i have requested this interview i will tell you in two words sir i will not marry count andrea <unk> <unk> leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven	57.242958068847656

i shall strangle you both if you do not get out said porthos at last seizing <unk> by the throat	56.02830505371094

athos threw a piece of money to the <unk> to withdraw	25.677974700927734
five minutes elapsed during which franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the campagna and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion	79.40306854248047
the englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity evidently mingled with interest	60.03706359863281

almost instantly a female head was put out at the window with two fingers placed upon her mouth either to enjoin silence or to send him a kiss	122.74104309082031
indeed sir i thank you you have recalled one of the most agreeable recollections of my <unk> will you permit me then to recall another to you relating to him yes and no. faith said madame de chevreuse say on	85.03019714355469
<unk> said <unk> but you were right to return as soon as possible my <unk> and why because mercédès is a very fine girl and fine girls never lack followers she particularly has them by <unk> really answered edmond with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness	128.1787872314453
the will was never <unk> to get away you would not mind you added knocking down a door or a <unk> it is <unk> said so and i say it <unk> and i answered you porthos that it was not a good plan that we could not go a hundred steps without being recaptured because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend <unk> that is true we should need clothes and <unk> well said d <unk> rising we have them friend porthos and even something <unk> bah said porthos looking around	97.31348419189453
only he is not quite sure about the women for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of <unk> the two young men looked at <unk> as if to say are you mad or are you laughing at us and i also said morrel thoughtfully have heard something like this from an old sailor named <unk> ah cried albert it is very lucky that m. morrel comes to aid me you are vexed are you not that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth my dear albert said debray what you tell us is so <unk> ah because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of <unk> have no time	104.03608703613281
athos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender melancholy he looked long on this young man whose smiling mouth and half closed eyes bespoke soft dreams and lightest slumber as if his guardian angel watched over him with solicitude and affection	221.311767578125
no sir and it must be admitted that she seemed very <unk> in fact said aramis there is no time lost and we made our journey quickly	81.40284729003906
yes happy as myself said he	26.581165313720703
it was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to speak and this took another ten minutes	82.49427032470703
here is a sword and a dress said porthos	37.41978073120117
the fact is said d <unk> if men are punished for imprudence and triviality this poor king deserves punishment	130.92063903808594
<unk> another <unk> the bottle was brought with a promptness which showed the degree of consideration d <unk> enjoyed in the establishment	70.17523956298828
i followed her i caught her i bound her and i imprinted the same disgraceful mark upon her that i had imprinted upon my poor brother	121.95391845703125
she would have questioned him as he passed by her but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed oh mademoiselle mademoiselle what a dreadful misfortune	171.0952606201172
the intrepid <unk> walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the mass	120.83483123779297
open sir she said and look for <unk> mazarin opened the coffer a knife covered with rust and two letters one of which was stained with blood alone met his gaze	148.05662536621094
i have not yet had time to see him again	47.68092727661133
what have you to do with politeness i should like to know	90.30819702148438
no it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us but you hypocritically provoked <unk> i yes you	157.91847229003906
hers had been accomplished it remains possibly for us to accomplish <unk> i have sometimes thought as you do <unk> she had a son that unhappy woman <unk> have you ever heard of him <unk> he must be about twenty-three years of age said athos in a low tone	59.8088493347168
and yet as he journeyed along a profound sadness weighed upon his heart	92.56160736083984
if you heard the cry of mad dog you would take your <unk> would unhesitatingly shoot the poor beast who after all was only guilty of having been bitten by another dog	146.61843872070312
this time it was a great matter that was under discussion connected with a vessel laden with turkey carpets stuffs of the levant and cashmeres	97.4487533569336
dantès himself was simply but <unk> clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant <unk> costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb and with his fine countenance radiant with joy and happiness a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined	124.48738861083984
the comte de la fere he cried in his turn	14.656547546386719
they accepted his offer but wishing to make the best use of the time that was left albert started for naples	74.95016479492188
why about ten or eleven of the <unk> shall we watch by the corpse of what use would it be	164.8176727294922
you call yourself in paris the count of monte cristo in italy sinbad the sailor in malta i forget what	40.36579513549805
you ask what god is doing	43.80268096923828
he decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand <unk> at which he estimated the prisoners	71.6778335571289
they descended to the first floor albert led his guest into the salon	167.3160400390625
they galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the wall	37.20289993286133
<unk> calm yourself my friend said the count with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent and which now expressed only the <unk> feeling i am not an inspector but a traveller brought here by a curiosity he half repents of since he causes you to lose your <unk> ah my time is not valuable replied the man with a melancholy smile	127.1391372680664
so to-night mordaunt go to greenwich and ask for the captain of the felucca lightning	69.2123794555664
now continued faria addressing dantès with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as i do myself	68.50732421875
we must seize the felucca said aramis	49.207271575927734
but said d <unk> i trust that you honorably sent them back to monsieur le cardinal ah yes said aramis toward him i should be very likely to practice such delicacy of sentiment	117.58857727050781
here it is said aramis with a little look of diffidence which however was not exempt from a shade of hypocrisy vous qui <unk> un passé plein de charmes et qui <unk> des jours <unk> tous vos <unk> se <unk> <unk> quand à dieu seul vous <unk> vos <unk> vous qui <unk> you who weep for pleasures fled while dragging on a life of care all your woes will melt in air if to god your tears are she would you who weep d <unk> and the curate appeared pleased	61.5523681640625
really my dear gérard you are but a child you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has told you three days after the landing the usurper has landed at cannes with several men	119.46208953857422
yes for time <unk> how many men have you about the palais royal six <unk> place a hundred around the king and with the remainder sweep away this mob for me. madame cried mazarin what are you about go said the queen	93.20030212402344
she will try to seduce you perhaps she will try to kill you	82.44778442382812
felton took advantage of this moment and plunged the knife into his side up to the handle	96.09686279296875
suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church opened	44.30781555175781
<unk> your helm cried the captain to the steersman	35.51065444946289
this war may not only bring great catastrophes upon england and france but misfortune upon you my lord for which i should never console myself	163.7807159423828
i have made money at the same time by speculations which have succeeded	46.41067123413086
three days afterwards this poor vulture which has been very much indisposed since that dinner suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds and falls heavily into a <unk>	162.02650451660156
do you know him aramis as well as you do gentlemen for i was among those who seized him in the garden at amiens into which monsieur <unk> the queen s equerry introduced me	90.9793472290039
only imagine what happiness that would afford me	42.366085052490234
he saw then that he was with a poet	40.03734588623047
he is awaiting your majesty at cours la <unk> but in what carriage do we start i have provided for everything a carriage below is waiting for your <unk> let us go to the <unk> d <unk> bowed and followed the queen	83.53245544433594
that is <unk> for the lackeys resumed aramis but for the <unk> the <unk> we may say	80.30365753173828
then he looked around him and really recognized his dungeon	152.95828247070312
dead dead the cold sweat sprang to the young man s brow and his teeth chattered	30.602436065673828
let me look at that sapphire again the one i mentioned to you had one of its faces scratched by <unk> d <unk> took off the ring giving it again to athos	126.36901092529297
there said he demand thy child of carlini he will tell thee what has become of her and he returned to his companions	94.24829864501953
the mob had insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold fringe	45.400272369384766
has he not come said kitty	51.06071090698242
my dear franz m. maximilian morrel an excellent friend i have acquired in your absence and whose name you will hear me mention every time i make any allusion to affection wit or <unk> morrel hesitated for a moment he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to franz	84.3167724609375
oh tomorrow tomorrow i must have some pledge from you which will prove that you think of me and that you may not forget me take this and she slipped a ring from her finger onto d <unk> s	82.83969116210938
he was a man of twenty-five or six and held a piece of cloth which being a tailor he was about to make into a <unk>	54.631587982177734
felton i dare not tell you at what idea i smiled you would hold me in <unk> go on	143.56253051757812
ha ha ha and a frightful demoniac laugh finished the sentence which was lost in a hoarse rattle	87.46266174316406
love me too i will not torment you much but only on condition that you become a <unk> my young friend and a hearty <unk> <unk> but can i continue to visit madame de chevreuse i should say you could	87.22600555419922
planchet obtained from rochefort the rank of sergeant in the piedmont regiment	62.20064163208008
you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of project <unk> works	14.405171394348145
the witnesses thought he was dead but his adversary who knew he had not struck him offered him the assistance of his hand to rise	58.15513610839844
this confession said she growing paler what is this confession you gave de <unk> a meeting on thursday last in this very room did you not no no	203.1051025390625
can i have been intercepted by french telegrams to the pontifical authorities he resolved to end his anxiety	51.15822982788086
this moment was frightful if i had any doubts as to my misfortune these doubts had vanished in an overwhelming reality	218.04495239257812
the pope therefore blesses with the fingers	44.94674301147461
<unk> if they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave he would allow himself to be covered with earth and then as it was night the <unk> could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped	100.60819244384766
am i to say what you told me asked valentine	51.18752670288086
a few minutes more and the troop passed over their heads	103.82966613769531
now that i have the word of athos i can set <unk> d <unk> started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and with a simple passport from mazarin to secure his admission to the queen s presence	78.27520751953125
and what does he say asked porthos in a self-sufficient tone	24.369077682495117
i vow i should consider it a <unk> pledge it then you can borrow at least a thousand crowns on it	99.97191619873047
but when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men and the pleasure of leaving politics for a moment try to find your affectionate heart which you leave with your stick when you go to the <unk> but tell me said beauchamp what is life	103.16908264160156
with this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet	42.36433792114258
as a further precaution they had bound his hands	124.96865844726562
she did not therefore even attempt the least resistance and went out of the cottage	63.915462493896484
let us unfold them first and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his eminence than the others	143.53021240234375
princes must be knocked on the <unk> i remember it said athos	17.662221908569336
i not only promise but swear it said monte cristo extending his hand	44.51919937133789
they must <unk> all <unk> at one stroke by the thunder of men in default of god s	78.53605651855469
i did not like to go to him without first seeing <unk> why because the count is doubtless aware that i accompanied you to the meeting this <unk> <unk> it is probable said albert	90.74243927001953
presently a good solid wooden ladder was placed against the window	61.524375915527344
unfortunately the hour was badly chosen for a private conference	286.9598388671875
i will take the whole world as a witness of your crime and that until i have found an <unk> you are a prostitute said he in a voice of thunder and you shall undergo the punishment of prostitutes	56.88978576660156
in may we commenced operations and in the course of the month gained 450,000 francs	36.67863845825195
yes yes replied he i perceive that plainly but do you really believe it is she i am sure of <unk> nevertheless i confess i still <unk> but the <unk> on her shoulder she is some englishwoman who has committed a crime in france and has been branded in <unk> athos she is your wife i tell you repeated d <unk> only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each <unk> yes but i should think the other must be dead i hanged her so <unk> it was d <unk> who now shook his head in his turn	75.82255554199219
but as we have said bazin had not by his fortunate return removed more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends	153.4138641357422
he had been subjected to a severe disciplinary course of medicine at length he sent away all his doctors declaring that he preferred the disease to the treatment and came to paris where the fame of his wit had preceded him	97.17387390136719
you see then said albert that instead of opposing she will encourage me. adieu then until five of the clock be punctual and we shall arrive at twelve or <unk> at <unk> yes or in the <unk> but can we travel forty-eight leagues in eight hours easily said monte cristo	101.04276275634766
what is yonder cried d <unk>	3.4675450325012207
the marshal thought this barrier not so well fortified as the others and determined to break through it	132.3417205810547
but then he may have stopped at saint <unk> i do not think so we appointed to meet at la <unk> i was there this very <unk> and had the pretty madeleine no news asked aramis smiling	77.69889068603516
you suppose that i would ever accept the price of your life	58.95722961425781
oh if i had my three friends here cried he i should have at least some hopes of finding her but who knows what has become of them it was past midnight the next thing was to find planchet	125.3027572631836
father father in heaven s name exclaimed the young man what are these weapons for maximilian replied morrel looking fixedly at his son you are a man and a man of honor	54.40525436401367
oh traitors that ye are sire said athos this is not a moment for recrimination but a time to show yourself a king and a gentleman	61.21330642700195
d <unk> picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls and meeting nothing to suspect regained by the hatchway the deck of the vessel	103.50982666015625
it is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said i remember that <unk> <unk> and beauchamp looked at each other the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which <unk> had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued	81.66360473632812
<unk> shut the door and went away	20.673654556274414
four men disguised as workmen were to get the king out of prison and take him to greenwich where a vessel was <unk> and knowing all that your honor remained here far from the city tranquil and <unk> tranquil yes replied cromwell	148.51318359375
they arrived that very moment at the gate of the town guarded by two sentinels	52.52830505371094
come <unk> wait said monte cristo i wish to take one final glance around this <unk> this is fortunate said the guide i have forgotten the other <unk> go and fetch <unk> i will leave you the torch <unk> no take it away i can see in the <unk> why you are like no	69.29632568359375
mordaunt remained standing near the door	5.097381591796875
m. debray has made me lose 700,000 francs let him bear his share of the loss and we will go on as before if not let him become bankrupt for the 250,000 livres and do as all bankrupts <unk>	103.23650360107422
i love you so tenderly that i can not help being jealous even of the <unk> a smile which was indefinable passed over the lips of the queen	56.34403991699219
it is well for albert he is not in the army said morrel	46.117218017578125
fortunately as regarded this circumstance at least his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness and the glimmerings of <unk> seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory	150.99261474609375
consider monsieur the thing is absolutely <unk> monsieur <unk> said the commissary looking at the accused as if his little eyes had the faculty of reading to the very depths of hearts you have a wife yes monsieur replied the mercer in a tremble feeling that it was at this point affairs were likely to become perplexing that is to say i <unk> <unk> what you <unk> one	75.33930206298828
this time maximilian was the first to arrive	31.408899307250977
who has taken my piece of glass asked the duke frowning	128.93136596679688
the salon downstairs was only an algerian divan for the use of smokers	54.75089645385742
madame <unk> in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety had hesitated about going to madame de <unk> s when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of villefort	208.50845336914062
ah if you laugh if you doubt me replied aramis you shall know <unk> we believe like mohammedans and are as mute as tombstones said athos	60.550193786621094
and maximilian morrel left the room with the baron de <unk> leaving monte cristo alone with <unk>	41.7608528137207
it was of this detachment sent as a vanguard that our friend d <unk> formed a part	147.9356689453125
the handsome madeleine announced to d <unk> that planchet had returned bringing <unk> with him who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit	95.4500732421875
i say the two because cardinal rospigliosi who had not taken any precaution was completely despoiled	155.17193603515625
la <unk> carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would not stir	43.51889419555664
so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts and as d <unk> stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step but d <unk> seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of <unk> deviated from the line	82.31987762451172
the officers perceived that they had not to deal with a gentleman and they treated him like a very peasant	57.44267272949219
he shrugged his shoulders when people spoke of the future	200.9755096435547
he started when he saw renée for he fancied she was again about to plead for dantès	154.63339233398438
maximilian who was paying them a visit listened to their conversation or rather was present at it plunged in his accustomed state of apathy	141.78602600097656
and when jacopo inquired of him what is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me edmond replied who knows	103.86155700683594
to lose you my friendship if he were conquered and see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor	192.53036499023438
for i am sure the count is his father	52.41167068481445
you were rich noble held in great <unk> all that could render a man happy all said the major hastily swallowing his biscuit positively <unk> and yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness only one thing said the italian	137.343017578125
he walked to the window and looked into the court	21.315929412841797
then i shall also <unk> then rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man s head he slowly added by the blood of christ i swear never to leave you while you <unk> faria gazed fondly on his <unk> <unk> <unk> young friend and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose	61.7474479675293
i pardon you said he for the poisoning of my brother and the assassination of his grace lord buckingham	57.70072555541992
what do you mean <unk> album i want the <unk> how dare you tear out the drawings oh it amuses me. <unk> at <unk> i will not go unless you give me the album said the boy seating himself doggedly in an armchair according to his habit of never giving way	122.4468765258789
the count must feel sure that franz recognized him and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them	136.1757354736328
but not until two of the clock said d <unk> with the same calmness	14.954030990600586
is it to do us some ill turn	497.2543640136719
therefore said monte cristo feigning to mistake his <unk> therefore i will not for another instant retard the pleasure of your meeting	98.92672729492188
now as at the moment in which d <unk> fixed his eyes upon the gentleman in the violet doublet the gentleman made one of his most knowing and profound remarks respecting the <unk> pony his two auditors laughed even louder than before and he himself though contrary to his custom allowed a pale smile if i may be allowed to use such an expression to stray over his countenance	123.43914031982422
but on the contrary the particulars which are given prove that fernand mondego raised by ali pasha to the rank of governor-general is no other than count fernand of <unk> then recollecting the honor you had done me in admitting me to your friendship i hastened to <unk> albert still extended on the chair covered his face with both hands as if to prevent the light from reaching him	98.83779907226562
by the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken dantès saw the old man pale but yet erect clinging to the bedstead	103.68173217773438
for all this continued milady i should long ago have revenged myself on him if and i do not know why the cardinal had not requested me to conciliate <unk> oh yes but madame has not <unk> that little woman he was so fond <unk> what the mercer s wife of the rue des <unk>	71.30257415771484
at the noise they made she in overturning the furniture in her efforts to get at him he in screening himself behind the furniture to keep out of her reach kitty opened the door	111.73370361328125
<unk> morgen <unk> eth teen <unk> le <unk> the ge <unk> <unk> <unk> which means <unk> sir	38.53717803955078
yes a chef d oeuvre of the great florentine sculptor benvenuto cellini replied athos	27.660144805908203
ah there you are my good d <unk> i have given you a great fright have i not	66.39842987060547
your husband then is at last dead how does that concern you replied the swiss	92.99972534179688
no one has come out he replied	126.68840789794922
do you find me of sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me yes monsieur said the englishman bowing	123.13533020019531
do i know said he and do you believe that if i knew i would relate to you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel writer	68.81248474121094
well said d <unk> at last	66.92159271240234
in consequence of this feeling of repugnance he was about to pass without speaking to him but as he had done the day before m. <unk> accosted him	48.137882232666016
do you possess 400,000 francs inquired the notary	35.27414321899414
as for d <unk> he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the <unk> where he found porthos and aramis awaiting him	79.37857055664062
in france the first fear of the king of england charles i. on learning of the death of the duke was that such terrible news might discourage the <unk> he tried says richelieu in his <unk> to conceal it from them as long as possible closing all the ports of his kingdom and carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army which buckingham was getting together had gone taking upon himself in default of buckingham to superintend the departure	160.36251831054688
are you not the lieutenant fernand who served as guide and spy to the french army in spain	95.4122085571289
the sergeant drew near to planchet	119.26936340332031

bowing under the weight of twenty-four years reminiscences he thought not of albert of beauchamp of <unk> or of any of that group but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her son s life to whom he had offered his and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret capable of destroying forever in that young man s heart every feeling of filial piety	93.34195709228516

it is this sir said the king angrily that general cromwell has reached newcastle that you knew it and i was not informed of it that the enemy have left the town and are now closing the passages of the tyne against us that our sentinels have seen this movement and i have been left unacquainted with it that by an infamous treaty you have sold me for two hundred thousand pounds to parliament	105.941162109375
the lackeys were ordered to act as sentinels	63.09041976928711

it was many years since d <unk> had opened his heart to any one it happened however that these two men on meeting again assimilated perfectly	112.93898010253906
and she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely personal	342.1858215332031
the two kingdoms are so near that france must be interested in our situation as we are interested in that of france	83.69452667236328
let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two musketeers and return to athos	41.296756744384766

madame said he you are about to receive a visit from the chancellor who will communicate certain matters to you with which i have charged <unk> the unfortunate queen who was constantly threatened with divorce exile and trial even turned pale under her rouge and could not refrain from saying but why this visit sire	94.2557601928711

he pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted	55.168792724609375
then casting a glance on the handsome young man who was scarcely twenty-five years of age and whom he was leaving in his gore deprived of sense and perhaps dead he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist	83.42318725585938
arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed turned around and looking insolently at the frenchmen passed some jests from one to another	83.20576477050781
d <unk> on his return sent the twelve bottles of wine to the refreshment room of the guards with strict orders that great care should be taken of it and then on the day appointed as the dinner was fixed for midday d <unk> sent planchet at nine in the morning to assist in preparing everything for the entertainment	116.22965240478516

so once more <unk> <unk> followed him slowly to the threshold	67.96878814697266
he had walked as one walks in a dream he had a glimpse of objects as through a fog	115.13345336914062
it was now nine of the clock	4.082340240478516
he sat down without saying a word to anybody and began to reflect	46.387393951416016

yes replied <unk> with an expression of sinister joy	19.849424362182617
then continued the host i replied that as from the moment we seemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment i hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his custom to my brother host of the golden eagle but monsieur porthos replied that my house being the best he should remain where he was	131.30044555664062
grimaud seemed to him an antinous	20.903324127197266
this movement revealed the spot where winter s body had fallen	183.5416259765625
someone has vexed you i will allow no one to annoy <unk> you are deceived lucien i assure you replied madame <unk> and what i have told you is really the case added to the <unk> you remarked but which i did not think it worth while to allude <unk> it was evident that madame <unk> was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently can not account for even to themselves or that as debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone	98.45645141601562
however as far as ali is concerned i can assure you the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your <unk> who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in <unk> really	95.1594467163086
he reached it before the carriage arrived	46.33927536010742

it also boasted of what in languedoc is styled a garden consisting of a small plot of ground on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests	80.06250762939453
what i was saying villefort was that the bonapartists had not our sincerity enthusiasm or <unk> they had however what supplied the place of those fine qualities replied the young man and that was fanaticism	141.6628875732422
four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit	113.84170532226562
the sentence is passed and in a few hours will be executed it must be so and i will not endeavor to prevent it	39.16600036621094
my dear fellow said debray you have come in the nick of time	33.203609466552734
anne de <unk> cried the monk standing up and lifting his hands to heaven	31.29511833190918
<unk> well read the letter again	92.08931732177734
<unk> moved by a double <unk> and curiosity	138.431884765625
you see sir he is really dead said the doctor this burn in the heel is decisive	116.49954223632812
trust me do not let us try to do things cheaply	94.47209930419922
albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day	131.26124572753906
<unk> was awaiting this arrival with impatience mingled with uneasiness he hoped for some compliments while at the same time he feared to have frowns	65.36054992675781
by my faith it is very fortunate that the letter was not in <unk> they will kill poor porthos when he comes up said aramis	76.58792877197266
he then tried to draw him from his moist abode but to his surprise he perceived that athos staggered	95.24693298339844
the piercing eye of peppino had noticed all	248.1768341064453
felton and he addressed patrick the duke s confidential lackey at the same moment	70.71430969238281
it had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength	545.991943359375
are you disposed to obey count de rochefort i would follow him to hell and that is saying not a little as i believe him entirely capable of the <unk> bravo by what sign to-morrow shall we be able to distinguish friends from foes every <unk> must put a knot of straw in his <unk> good	147.29478454589844
madame he replied monsieur d <unk> s prediction has been accomplished they are calm as if by enchantment	45.153934478759766
this time i have merely come from <unk> you have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit	111.06340026855469
i parted from him two years ago at palermo and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions so that i fear he will never <unk> oh monsieur this is cruel of you said julie much affected and the young lady s eyes swam with tears	69.37680053710938
there were then great griefs tears without end and solemn promises to remain <unk> of course on the part of the hostess	131.9261932373047
but this war may bring round a peace this peace will require a negotiator that negotiator will be me	225.31201171875
en route monsieur d <unk> said the cardinal all goes well in this <unk> d <unk> in the meantime had taken the head of his detachment without a word and with that ready and profound obedience which marks the character of an old soldier	59.46660614013672
this is one of those attempts that happen every <unk> are you sure that we are not its objects we	96.40510559082031
i have proposed to you to marry not for your sake for indeed i did not think of you in the least at the moment you admire candor and will now be satisfied i hope but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible on account of certain commercial speculations i am desirous of entering <unk> eugénie became uneasy	94.03256225585938
ah said he involuntarily following <unk> s eyes which were fixed on madame de villefort who repeated this poor child would be better in bed	72.69658660888672
well i had promised madame de villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the bois but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they are <unk> gone	78.28035736083984
a customs officer was laid low and two sailors wounded dantès was one of the latter a ball having touched him in the left shoulder	181.6748504638672
decidedly said <unk> with the perspiration on his forehead i must be under <unk> and he threw himself back in the <unk> not this time to sleep but to think	57.597965240478516
does monsieur de <unk> remain in paris she inquired	86.38751983642578
duke said <unk> you forget that to-morrow you are to command an expedition of the greatest importance projected by the prince assented to by the queen	68.89006805419922
debray rose smiling and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point when the door opened suddenly	105.64261627197266
you have lived on the money he has given <unk> true said <unk> benedetto has become the son of a great <unk> how can he be the son of a great lord a natural <unk> and what is that great lord s name the count of monte cristo the very same in whose house we <unk> benedetto the count s son replied monte cristo astonished in his turn	63.786277770996094
then after a moment of reverie he remembered where he had left d <unk> and porthos and that they must have overheard everything	57.84369659423828
she then replaced the bonnet and saw with pleasure in a little <unk> that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible	95.15369415283203
i see it and i thank you for it	19.931852340698242
in five minutes three were slightly wounded one on the hand another on the ear by the defender of the stair who himself remained <unk> piece of skill which was worth to him according to the rules agreed upon three turns of favor	166.80072021484375
i have lent him to a <unk> who will understand the signs he makes returned d <unk>	59.202999114990234
those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn more striking than the raging sea rolling with its deafening roar its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry moon	108.77945709228516
who would have come to the assistance of two strangers two unknown persons	119.69746398925781
then he arranged all his beautiful turkish arms his fine english guns his japanese china his cups mounted in silver his artistic bronzes by <unk> or barye examined the cupboards and placed the key in each threw into a drawer of his <unk> which he left open all the <unk> he had about him and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his <unk> then he made an exact inventory of everything and placed it in the most conspicuous part of the table after putting aside the books and papers which had collected there	77.00447082519531
posterity will find a difficulty in understanding this character which history explains only by facts and never by reason	291.8974609375
but it seems you have come back rich my boy continued the tailor looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which dantès had thrown on the table	85.3253173828125
a last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested it	52.527652740478516
they are good soldiers fit to confront the two violent adversaries whose address and resolution your eminence is fearful <unk> oh cried athos	124.50626373291016
he continued to follow the path to the glade but to his great surprise carlini arrived almost as soon as himself	93.9078140258789
brave rash and enterprising this was not the first time he had risked his life in such attempts	53.64906692504883
as for raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by d <unk> to leave the room until the tumult was over	80.4022445678711
if they meant to execute him at la <unk> it could scarcely be worth while to gag him as they had nearly reached the place of execution	110.30549621582031
d <unk> s countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion he began to think he had to do with madmen	60.39033889770508
had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her <unk> been previously acquainted with her so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind or at least have greatly astonished him	220.6717071533203
whose is that letter of your mistress	62.22479248046875
but <unk> take <unk> is your own for as long as you like	78.60259246826172
i should tell you that we lived in the little village of <unk> at the extremity of cap corse	39.25359344482422
are we mistaken and is dantès triumphant in spite of all we have believed why we must inquire into that was <unk> s reply and turning towards the young man said well catalan can not you make up your mind fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow and slowly entered the arbor whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to his senses and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted body	189.8135528564453
now then all is agreed let us go <unk> you are going into the garden <unk> go along this corridor down a little staircase and you are in <unk> excellent thank you and the two women parted exchanging charming smiles	89.90174102783203
she was beautiful but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious taste her hair was raven black but its natural waves seemed somewhat rebellious her eyes of the same color as her hair were surmounted by <unk> brows whose great defect however consisted in an almost habitual frown while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler attributes of her <unk> nose was precisely what a sculptor would have chosen for a chiselled juno	167.74334716796875
his visit was announced to the governor who on hearing that he came from the cardinal went to meet him and received him at the top of the great flight of steps outside the door	42.73759841918945
sir replied comminges it seems that it is <unk> monsieur de comminges said athos i have been a soldier all my life and i know the force of orders but outside your orders there is a service you can render me. i will do it with all my heart said comminges for i know who you are and what service you once performed for her majesty i know too how dear to you is the young man who came so valiantly to my aid when that old rogue of a <unk> was arrested	77.91574096679688
d <unk> needs to be alone to weep and to sleep	53.856849670410156
do you want any money no sir i have all my pay to <unk> three months <unk> you are a careful fellow <unk> say i have a poor father <unk> yes yes i know how good a son you are so now hasten away to see your father	90.8341293334961
scarcely had he gone ten steps when his ears began to tingle a faintness seized him a cloud of blood passed over his eyes and he fell in the middle of the street crying still coward	57.43149948120117
it is a prisoner said edmond joyfully	74.18255615234375
charles listened with marked attention passing over the insults noting the grievances and when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser turned executioner beforehand replying with a smile of lofty scorn	160.31350708007812
you were too young to know about such <unk> i do not remember what he did but i have inquired and i have been told all about <unk> and who told you about it asked anne of austria with a movement of impatience	47.11157989501953
i respect your convictions and whilst we fight for opposite sides let us remain friends	304.1204833984375
the cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew near	34.238067626953125
the person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of franz stood in a kind of <unk> that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made out	101.65108489990234
and thou hast not hurled thy thunder at him my god	169.20164489746094
but you are not the king my son and can never be so while they are alive	77.9822006225586
the duke walked so fast that d <unk> had some trouble in keeping up with him	57.850318908691406
they are quite new and have not yet been used	86.26469421386719
you thought to escape my munificence but it is in vain	61.98784637451172
as the count was immensely rich excepting the danger carmela had run <unk> the marvellous manner in which she had escaped made that appear to him rather a favor of providence than a real misfortune <unk> loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle	132.54481506347656
during this time exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief the royal army led a joyous life neither provisions nor money being wanting in the camp	286.7552185058594
porthos and aramis were so engaged with their game and athos was watching them with so much attention that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the guardsman of his eminence stopped outside the door	75.77192687988281
certainly it is empty replied the procurator s wife in real innocence	35.52012252807617
he planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor	32.67897033691406
the two arms fell with a sudden force they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow	72.28604125976562
his signal was returned and in two hours afterwards the <unk> lay at anchor beside the yacht	47.99903869628906
these horses evidently belonged to the three men who were dressed as cavaliers	49.200443267822266
the stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty-five years but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time	118.48546600341797
their disappearance at first caused much <unk> but it was soon known that they had joined <unk>	132.78762817382812
at this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door continued to exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came up to the prisoner	66.07882690429688
what have they done to you <unk> you not see what they did no. they laughed when we swore that we had done our duty in england	115.90572357177734
the count was alone with morrel who remained motionless as a statue	49.4164924621582
why what good would it do asked <unk>	109.3708724975586
i am almost inclined to ask you as though you had experienced death is it painful to die monte cristo looked upon morrel with indescribable tenderness	79.97940063476562
may i at least return asked morrel	291.1407165527344
he too ten years ago had piously sought out a tomb and sought it vainly	152.69171142578125
has monsieur de beaufort escaped from vincennes i do not think so my lord said <unk> but you will hear about him for la <unk> is here and awaits the commands of your <unk> tell him to come in said mazarin arranging his pillows so that he might receive the visitor sitting up in bed	70.859619140625
you know that even now the king is but a child and the queen a woman weak enough	111.15647888183594
apropos continued he franz is coming soon but it will not interest you you dislike him i think i said monte cristo my dear viscount how have you discovered that i did not like m. franz	79.4124984741211
indeed almost before the door opened the scene changed	100.32765197753906
he then saw that he must make another struggle against the grief of his friend and taking the hands of emmanuel and julie which he pressed within his own he said with the mild authority of a father my kind friends leave me alone with <unk> julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic which monte cristo had forgotten	173.2092742919922
take your glass then and let us drink	29.471881866455078
monsieur the coadjutor s carriage she exclaimed falling back	117.64718627929688
war has broken out in flanders	55.184471130371094
there d <unk> was asleep upon a bench	99.85600280761719
he relates that he met at brussels rochefort the <unk> <unk> of the cardinal disguised as a capuchin and that this cursed rochefort thanks to his disguise had tricked monsieur de <unk> like a ninny as he <unk> a ninny indeed said porthos but is the matter certain i had it from aramis replied the musketeer	104.5322036743164
alas what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good <unk> then he said aloud listen morrel i see your grief is great but still you do not like to risk your <unk> morrel smiled sadly	84.86934661865234
faria as we have said without having recovered the use of his hand and foot had regained all the clearness of his understanding and had gradually besides the moral instructions we have detailed taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner who learns to make something from nothing	168.6646728515625
their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful <unk>	89.74977111816406
a real father yes so long as he pays <unk> you will honor and believe <unk> is right	140.48849487304688
still then i am a prisoner said milady looking around her and bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer but i feel assured it will not be for long added she	76.45850372314453
your power is great i know but you also know that with the help of god men have often conquered the most terrible demons	111.58744049072266
comminges so to speak threw <unk> into the carriage and sprang in after him	81.30892181396484
see how deadly pale he is	202.0092315673828
at each moment in the midst of the crowd the buzzing and the laughter the <unk> s voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department respected in the army or illustrious in the literary world and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups	80.27720642089844
they were playing together as usual when seven of the clock sounded the patrol was heard passing to double the posts	75.19451904296875
what shall we do said athos	17.931407928466797
let us go in said monte cristo	16.410852432250977
he forgot that besides his friends of his own sex a woman strange to say had remembered him	88.77410125732422
mademoiselle d <unk> whom they then perceived through the open doorway formed with eugénie one of the <unk> <unk> of which the germans are so fond	128.4694366455078
but cried anne of austria tired of these vague attacks but sire you do not tell me all that you have in your heart	64.4756088256836
the races like the <unk> are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the carnival	62.847808837890625
i will neither open my mouth nor draw my sword between this and calais	217.5368194580078
yes there are and most hideous or rather most admirable ones for i found them ugly enough to frighten me. come my dear albert said debray confess that your cook is <unk> that the oysters have not arrived from ostend or <unk> and that like madame de maintenon you are going to replace the dish by a story	112.85214233398438
my lords answered he it is not by time i could repel the attack made on me by enemies unknown to me and doubtless hidden in obscurity it is immediately and by a thunderbolt that i must repel the flash of lightning which for a moment startled me	134.38510131835938
you were my tutor why did you not teach me to swim oh monsieur le comte replied the old man had any misfortune happened to you i should never have dared to show myself to the marshal <unk> but how did the accident happen asked raoul	85.34212493896484
he aimed a terrible blow at d <unk> who avoided it by springing to one side but by this movement he left a passage free to the bandit who darted off toward the bastion	96.26982116699219
and who brought you up he asked again	146.78128051757812
at what hour does the examination take place at two of the <unk> send at twelve said <unk> smiling	111.01457977294922
her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening so that she perceived franz and albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to franz	93.80339813232422
he lost it the day before <unk> and <unk> and the host took their way together toward the inn <unk> according to the custom of <unk> well pleased with their place relating to the <unk> all that he could say in favor of the young gentleman whilst raoul wrote on thus sir <unk> a four hours march i stop to write to you for i miss you every moment and i am always on the point of turning my head as if to reply when you speak to me	96.72314453125
a man of spirit is not to be reminded of such services	84.32151794433594
inspector continued the governor i can tell you the story as well as he for it has been <unk> in my ears for the last four or five <unk> that proves returned the abbé that you are like those of holy writ who having eyes see not and having ears hear <unk> my dear sir the government is rich and does not want your treasures replied the inspector keep them until you are <unk> the abbé s eyes glistened he seized the inspector s hand	92.4498291015625

yes i received the news this evening by a courier	67.13670349121094
do you wish these proofs these attestations which i alone possess to be destroyed	73.60214233398438
edmond had one friend only and thus it can not be divided	92.19876861572266
he crossed the sea and brought back the set of ornaments to the great queen who was able to wear them on her shoulder on the appointed day and this very nearly ruined the minister	125.35564422607422
milady had had time during the whole day to trace her plan of conduct	104.09011840820312
so pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me wait and after that tell me why i see you in a dress so singular that at first i did not recognize <unk> dearest valentine said the young man the difference between our respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love but yet i can not find myself in your presence without longing to pour forth my soul and tell you how fondly i adore you	87.62834167480469
they never buried the dead they merely attached a heavy <unk> to the feet and then threw them into the sea	63.0955924987793
come then as early as you <unk> seven of the clock but beware if you and your musketeers are <unk> if my musketeers are guilty sire the guilty shall be placed in your majesty s hands who will dispose of them at your good pleasure	82.65467834472656

the journey at two of the clock in the morning our four adventurers left paris by the barrière st. denis	27.132892608642578
and we have just heard continued albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one that although i have seen him today for the first time i request you to allow me to introduce him as my <unk> at these words it was still possible to observe in monte cristo the concentrated look changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion	110.12181854248047
embrace also our good and brave porthos	144.12091064453125
i will take all the blame on myself if you find i have led you into an <unk> well then if it be so are you ready albert <unk> let us go and return our best thanks for his <unk> yes let us do so. the landlord preceded the friends across the landing which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count rang at the bell and upon the door being opened by a servant said <unk> signori <unk> the domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to enter	96.77674865722656

i will be an abbé if it suits me	138.43519592285156
meanwhile ali had procured the arms the count <unk> a short carbine and a pair of double-barrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a <unk> one	83.10282897949219
what had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of france in the terrible events which had occurred in england which they thought should have arrested the attention of all europe	81.00939178466797
i have no greater regard for the bastille than you	116.28803253173828
edmond resigned the lugger to the master s care and went and lay down in his hammock but in spite of a sleepless night he could not close his eyes for a moment	52.38236618041992
i can not help thinking that he has brought his son to france to choose a <unk> do you think so i am sure of <unk> and you have heard his fortune mentioned nothing else was talked of only some said he was worth millions and others that he did not possess a <unk> and what is your opinion i ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal <unk> well and it is <unk> my opinion is that all these old <unk> these ancient <unk> <unk> the cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provinces <unk> opinion i say is that they have buried their millions in corners the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons who have done the same from generation to generation and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance like the florins of the republic which from being constantly gazed upon have become reflected in <unk> certainly said <unk> and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of <unk> very little at least i know of none which cavalcanti possesses excepting his palace in <unk> ah he has a palace said <unk> laughing come that is <unk> yes and more than that he let us it to the minister of finance while he lives in a simple house	109.37300872802734

i told my wife several times that it was surprising that linen drapers should live in such houses as those in houses that had no signs but she always laughed at me	162.85475158691406
27 and stopped in the yard	28.158662796020508
on the eighth day after the scene we have described the cardinal received a letter with the london stamp which only contained these lines i have them but i am unable to leave london for want of money	80.36138153076172
but will you be able to follow me oh yes your wound gives me pain but will not prevent my <unk> be ready then at the first <unk> milady shut the window extinguished the lamp and went as felton had desired her to lie down on the bed	105.31011199951172
franz took it with a nervous trembling and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively until he came to m. at that letter the old man signified <unk> m repeated franz	110.19851684570312

the general alighted leaning on the arm of the president of whose dignity he was not aware considering him simply as a member of the club they went through the alley mounted a flight of stairs and entered the <unk>	47.934837341308594

the baron has just related a frightful story to me. milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim and shook her head	137.87594604492188
in the meantime d <unk> took his way toward the rue <unk> where he lived at the hotel de la chevrette	15.063591957092285
thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition	57.639591217041016
the young man prepared for this scene by the state of his own feelings which were mournful and by the majesty of the cathedral which he had passed through descended in a slow and solemn manner and stood with head uncovered before these mortal spoils of the last king who was not to be placed by the side of his forefathers until his successor should take his place there and who appeared to abide on that spot that he might thus address human pride so sure to be exalted by the glories of a throne dust of the earth	86.84746551513672
there you see it will not take long. yes <unk> do this and you will have nectarines and all the <unk> the shot told red with fever while the large drops fell from his brow the man executed one after the other the three signs given by the count in spite of the frightful contortions of the right-hand correspondent who not understanding the change began to think the gardener had gone mad	95.5660171508789
had entertained toward mazarin and he endeavored to receive the minister s homage with civility	50.586647033691406
a secret voice whispered to him at the bottom of his heart that he was but an instrument of vengeance that he was only caressed till he had given death but pride but self-love but madness silenced this voice and stifled its murmurs	81.7315444946289
i knew you were gloomy and always brooding over some old history of the vendetta and i overlooked that in italy because in italy those things are thought nothing of	200.72879028320312

certainly and why should i regret what gives you pleasure oh	310.88848876953125
one may well perceive young man that you are inexperienced	69.87722778320312

he had us in his power and he let us go	22.281524658203125

let m. de rochefort enter said mazarin eagerly on hearing their names pronounced and beg m. d <unk> to wait i shall have further need of <unk> these words gave great joy to d <unk>	121.30099487304688
and the troop continued their route	16.843515396118164
meantime monsieur who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the duc d angoulême by <unk> or by schomberg who were all eager for his post did but little lost his days in wavering and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the english from the isle of ré where they still besieged the citadel st. martin and the fort of la <unk> as on their side the french were besieging la rochelle	65.84339904785156
now in spite of the nobility of his countenance the command of which like a finished actor he had carefully studied before the glass it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity	103.4905776977539
do you mean at rome i <unk> ah then i suppose you heard haydée s <unk> the poor exile frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native <unk> <unk> did not pursue the subject and monte cristo himself fell into a silent reverie	116.9873046875

now the successor of pere marteau had promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl and chambertin wine instead of macon	60.29690933227539
eugénie she said to herself is lost and so are we	189.4529266357422
gold a devoted friend and a letter from the king our husband and <unk> de winter bowed again unable to reply from excess of emotion	75.69063568115234
madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added we thought this news would possess an interest for you sir who have always entertained a great affection for valentine it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined	85.81646728515625
yes i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosi s and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two <unk> for andrea <unk> asked franz	110.40884399414062
at last they stood face to face in the very room where ten minutes before mordaunt had been talking to cromwell	145.46446228027344

the cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice and the king was very pale	14.19120979309082
during ten minutes he alone kept the crowd at bay at last comminges appeared pushing <unk> before him	206.76531982421875
franz and albert descended the carriage approached the palace their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats the <unk> sprang into the seat behind	113.03681945800781
well if you know them you know that they are good and free companions	70.13446807861328
go upstairs she said to the doctor	25.795196533203125
come shall we take our luncheon and then pay a last visit to st. peter s franz silently assented and the following afternoon at half-past five of the clock the young men parted	70.12370300292969
he was moderately reassured however by the aspect of that countenance full of astute intelligence and affected humility	151.02049255371094
the lackeys were sent on before with the baggage and they set out on the morning of the sixteenth	49.869117736816406
you will find very few persons who will go and brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a <unk> or will administer to him in order to remove him from the surface of the globe on which we move with life and animation that quantity of arsenic of which we just now talked	71.62962341308594
and to you also m. morrel my thanks are due	702.9802856445312
the doctors anxious for my lungs had prescribed the air of naples	104.41447448730469
the other was a large square epistle resplendent with the terrible arms of his eminence the cardinal duke	70.84947967529297
then she ventured to ask what had become of felton	120.53777313232422
milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the comte de <unk> and she ordered kitty to come at nine of the clock in the morning to take a third letter	31.5328311920166
the bitter cup of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs and i feel that the grave is not far distant	46.340450286865234
i will send you to <unk> no lest on the first demonstration i make in favor of mehemet ali the sultan send me the bowstring and make my secretaries strangle me. you say very true responded debray	127.12500762939453

the utility of stovepipes chapter xlv	10.109654426574707

what encouraged me not to become your surety but to patronize you <unk> father s name so well known in italy and so highly honored	76.85909271240234
yes surely he came with the prince a charming young man he is one of your friends then monsieur le comte yes sir answered athos agitated so much so that i wish to see him if <unk> quite possible sir do me the favor to accompany me and i will conduct you to <unk> <unk> there cried aramis turning around what a noise behind us a body of cavaliers is coming toward us said chatillon	90.3635025024414
athos by signs desired grimaud to bring another bottle of wine	92.42668914794922
nevertheless he continued in the tone of one who gives wholesome advice i think it is better not to make <unk> then said raoul this monsieur scarron is a poet yes you are warned vicomte	82.77185821533203
they were at that part of the quai des ormes where the steps lead down to the river	56.06149673461914
in the morning felton came as usual but milady allowed him to preside over all the preparations for breakfast without addressing a word to him	99.80659484863281
but he had been unable to send to albert the following particulars as the events had transpired after the messenger s departure namely that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the house of peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly	85.77318572998047
as soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent <unk>	71.98274230957031
dantès would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his voice	65.43435668945312
certainly in the eyes of an artist the exact and strict costume of teresa had a very different character from that of carmela and her companions and teresa was frivolous and coquettish and thus the embroidery and muslins the cashmere <unk> all dazzled her and the reflection of sapphires and diamonds almost turned her giddy brain	121.68624114990234
at all events she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands of her brother-in-law with whom she reckoned she could deal very easily rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent enemy	109.40201568603516
i have brought her here sir and i have deposited her in charge of charlotte who till better advice comes has bathed the foot in cold <unk> the guests now all took leave of athos excepting the old duc de barbe who as an old friend of the family of la valliere went to see little louise and offered to take her to blois in his carriage	154.29495239257812
the days of expectation are long and d <unk> in particular would have wagered that the days were forty-four hours	76.71680450439453
then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and <unk> in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppino <unk> engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled	97.02616882324219
but d <unk> had now slipped through the window	89.79669189453125
hunger made <unk> once repugnant now acceptable he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat of tainted fish of black and mouldy bread	88.65489196777344
none of those interesting adventures fell in his way the lovely genoese florentines and neapolitans were all faithful if not to their husbands at least to their lovers and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of albert de <unk> and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of italy have this advantage over those of france that they are faithful even in their infidelity	113.43373107910156
a young <unk> can sketch his portrait at a dash	103.9764175415039
and now you will do me a favor will you not what is it do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen and should they wish it you will warn me. just then the count felt his arm pressed	89.92018127441406
or rather at what he said and what was he saying he said this madame mazarin is a <unk>	81.4948959350586
i shall use it again upon <unk> and with all the swiftness of his legs already a little fatigued however with the perambulations of the day d <unk> directed his course toward m. de <unk> s	47.24118423461914
whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a cloak came and stood just before the hogshead behind which grimaud on hearing him come in instantly crept	86.24009704589844
it may easily be understood therefore that the conversation during the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his eminence s guardsmen had received	91.11076354980469
he went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same price	77.44196319580078
the movement was executed in silence and with precision	62.045597076416016
teresa had yielded in spite of herself but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within him	69.01728057861328
thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her and the self-satisfied gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not fail to respond	87.53971862792969
after dinner the count of monte cristo was announced	11.802000999450684
the curates asked him what was to be done	27.05426597595215
i attach great importance to the question i am about to put to you	31.796070098876953
come along <unk> and let the young gentleman return to the catalans if he <unk> <unk> took advantage of <unk> s temper at the moment to take him off towards marseilles by the porte saint-victor staggering as he went	69.73413848876953
like all the great nobles of that period athos rode and fenced to perfection	98.63238525390625
thus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and who are perhaps the because of it but wait wait	112.47673797607422
four hundred and seventy-five livres said d <unk> who reckoned like archimedes	44.101341247558594
oh you need not be alarmed you will only have lost him as you have lost your daughter i mean that i shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty roads leading out of france	79.92755889892578
as to fortune he had <unk> humble as he <unk> enemy of the cardinal that is to say of a man before whom trembled the greatest men of the kingdom beginning with the king	55.885047912597656
i am as certain of it as that we two are <unk> the abbé with a shaking hand seized a glass of water that was standing by him half-full swallowed it at one gulp and then resumed his seat with red eyes and pale cheeks	89.378173828125
oh yes said the count you are looking for the <unk> yes i paid them nothing and yet they are <unk> never mind that maximilian said monte cristo smiling	44.01939010620117
no said albert nor even ancient greek my dear count never had homer or plato a more unworthy scholar than <unk> then said haydée proving by her remark that she had quite understood monte cristo s question and albert s answer then i will speak either in french or italian if my lord so wills <unk> monte cristo reflected one instant	114.77326202392578
straw they all cried out straw	215.57022094726562
he had but one <unk> was a gourmand he had found the pates good the wine excellent	146.9235076904297
do you know where i shall find him near blois	46.29722595214844
a peer of france ah said andrea who knows major cavalcanti is already one perhaps but then hereditary rank is <unk> no politics <unk>	266.5911560058594
then he went to call on monte cristo and heard still more	177.0574951171875
<unk> that is a fine age replied porthos	175.25201416015625
and then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in voiture s works but i am of the same opinion as the <unk> is a poet a true <unk> aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody	77.8182373046875
d <unk> was too good a swordsman to trifle with his opponent	45.16386032104492
i confess this staggers me. and it has staggered everybody	365.03472900390625
a man was introduced of simple mien who had the appearance of a tradesman	47.68124771118164
at five of the clock in the morning the straw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be had	36.556007385253906
to-day i am engaged in a different affair	47.27104187011719
let us see what porthos has found for <unk> and thanking the captain he regained the state cabin where his friends were	131.7699737548828
then among them glided like a pure ray like a christian angel in the midst of olympus one of those chaste figures those calm shadows those soft visions which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble <unk>	147.653564453125
d <unk> gave the open letter to kitty who at first was unable to comprehend it but who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second time	118.13896179199219
he resolved therefore to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the count	70.81729125976562
who was it you were talking with over there she asked	159.07070922851562
for a long time i had these words whispered in my ears and i chose the latter at any rate it is a french word	111.11647033691406
milady de boulogne evening of the twenty-fifth	19.853801727294922
ah madame he said why did you not make that request of me with you sir replied the baroness one can wish for nothing one is so sure to obtain it	84.39826965332031
the first act of franz was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness	49.68413543701172
did you see the postscript i did indeed	146.1837158203125
the man took his way toward the city	25.404510498046875
the misfortune is great but i think you have still a good number of falcons sparrow hawks and <unk> and not a man to instruct them	48.119258880615234
the count hastily descended presented himself at the already opened carriage door and held out his hand to a young woman completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered with gold	77.62940979003906
at last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumbling against the gates and de winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her majesty	85.76422882080078
anne then motioned to d <unk> to approach and he obeyed	44.88433074951172
the first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as winter re-entered it	181.93032836914062
if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to death	93.12162780761719
he was quite alone on one side was the vast wilderness of the saint-lazare on the other paris enshrouded in darkness	42.337974548339844
yes replied the young woman and fear much that he finds our home but a dull <unk> i will undertake to divert him replied the count	90.87013244628906
george villiers placed himself before the glass as we have said restored the undulations to his beautiful hair which the weight of his hat had disordered twisted his mustache and his heart swelling with joy happy and proud at being near the moment he had so long sighed for he smiled upon himself with pride and hope	82.59149169921875
i believe these fellows have managed their business	77.44742584228516
it will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying out down with mazarin	144.92816162109375
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life	89.76805114746094
have i sir comprehended your instructions athos smiled	127.66572570800781

yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which mercédès had accepted yet it is impossible that so <unk> a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love or rather delirium	162.95761108398438

it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de <unk> and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the <unk> tinge of his own heated imagination	76.73220825195312

what would my good father say who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal if he knew i was in the society of such pagans we have no need therefore to say that d <unk> dared not join in the conversation only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard-of things which were taking place	111.36673736572266

leisurely turning round they calmly scrutinized the various countenances around them as though demanding some one person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they deemed excessive impertinence but as no one responded to the challenge the friends turned again to the front of the theatre and affected to busy themselves with the stage	120.34405517578125

on his part the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect	79.78495025634766
monte cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was worked	128.57041931152344

he attacked this wall cemented by the hand of time with his pickaxe	55.362586975097656

the first person to attract the attention of dantès as he landed on the <unk> was one of the crew belonging to the <unk>	35.60105514526367
at the knock the door was immediately opened and the young man who was seated beside the countess in obedience to the italian custom instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers who in turn would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors	84.6982192993164
you have committed a piece of folly said athos but it can not be helped there is no drawing back	99.90315246582031

the cardinal s hair stood on end	109.81736755371094

she could scarcely believe in her happiness and d <unk> was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written	68.69102478027344
some unknown <unk> invisible <unk> done <unk> the more must you fortify yourself albert	200.08042907714844

d <unk> then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white object which she unfolded quickly and which took the form of a handkerchief	76.95675659179688
if i strike with the sword or discharge the contents of a pistol at man with whom for three years i have been on terms of intimacy i must at least know why i do so i must meet him with a heart at ease and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own arm must save his <unk> well said <unk> impatiently what does all this mean it means that i have just returned from <unk> from yanina <unk> impossible here is my passport examine the <unk> milan venice trieste <unk> yanina	105.04505920410156

there was no time to lose	15.551033020019531
that is my <unk> capital failing i admit but with that exception i am a good <unk> athos spoke this in so natural a manner that d <unk> was shaken in his conviction	77.15707397460938
but there is the cardinal always at hand who does not leave me a moment s repose who talks to me about spain who talks to me about austria who talks to me about england	146.222412109375

all has gone according to my wishes	26.766807556152344
he saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy	87.13414001464844
the storm increased the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly the thunder began to growl and the wind the precursor of a hurricane whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen	38.096012115478516
arriving at the window parry found an unfinished scaffold over which they were nailing a covering of black serge	63.815269470214844

madame said the viscount of <unk> advancing towards the countess yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop i am rather late in claiming this gracious promise but here is my friend whose character for veracity you well know and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of <unk> and as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers	99.11578369140625
one only needs to be sharp that is all	63.6794548034668

i do not jest said athos	10.252510070800781
this movement was observed by mordaunt	35.828704833984375
the abbé made him smell the contents of the phial and he again opened his eyes	35.520816802978516

d <unk> charged with a party of musketeers up the rue du coq and the portion of the mob he assailed disappeared like smoke dispersing near the place saint <unk> auxerrois and taking the direction of the quays	65.37753295898438
i certainly think you act wisely in so doing said the priest	172.92356872558594

i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message	75.37620544433594

it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious <unk> much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths	113.49730682373047

you see then why i must decline your polite invitation which is especially attractive to me because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person the chances always balance and at the month s end nothing is gained or <unk> ah said <unk> sighing there is something still more wearisome and that is not to play at <unk> i can understand that said d <unk>	105.00009155273438
he complicated this exordium by an exposition in which he painted the power and the deeds of the cardinal that incomparable minister that conqueror of past ministers that example for ministers to <unk> and power which none could thwart with impunity	114.68382263183594
it is not at all amusing here there is not a single woman <unk> hush said athos we are <unk> in truth the walker who during the observations of the two friends had passed and repassed behind them several times stopped at the name of de winter but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this name it might have been by chance he stood so still	70.65023803710938

i beg you to return me that <unk> d <unk> obeyed and mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact	49.785343170166016
whatever command she had over herself milady could not help starting and as in pronouncing the last words lord de winter placed his hand upon the arm of his sister this start did not escape him	109.03042602539062
no stay here and try to make barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water	99.24995422363281
she was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at madame de villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky	63.22642517089844
all we have got to do is to keep our own counsel and remain perfectly quiet not breathing a word to any living soul and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting <unk> amen responded <unk> waving his hand in token of adieu to <unk> and bending his steps towards the <unk> de <unk> moving his head to and fro and muttering as he went after the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea	68.36702728271484
andrea cavalcanti or rather m. benedetto is nothing more nor less than an assassin sir i do not deny the justice of your correction but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man the more deeply will you strike our family	148.36236572265625
and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and eugénie appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian opera	92.44860076904297
but valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of health	88.42749786376953
but dantès can not remain forever in prison and one day or other he will leave it and the day when he comes out woe betide him who was the because of his incarceration oh i should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a quarrel with me. yes and mercédès	73.75581359863281
but athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his shoulders	48.123287200927734
a friend a wife a daughter have done us the honor to call us to their aid	75.51665496826172
villefort sprang into the room ran to valentine and took her in his arms	38.322120666503906
because if as you say athos and aramis are in real danger this is not the time to abandon them	75.68951416015625
there is the article of remunerations and <unk> to be discussed and set to <unk> chancellor said the queen turning to <unk> our old acquaintance you will open the conferences	56.89019012451172

with a word d <unk> reassured them and planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer as his master had come out safe from the <unk>	100.28961944580078
arrived at the foot of the back stairs he desired them to wait	123.9361572265625
while yet young unfortunately handsome i was dragged into a snare	96.33621978759766
dantès was tossed about on these doubts and wishes when the patron who had great confidence in him and was very desirous of retaining him in his service took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the via del oglio where the leading smugglers of leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade	88.14337921142578
just then the door opened and the jailer addressing himself to <unk> said excuse me sir but the examining magistrate is waiting for the <unk> and so closes our interview said andrea to the worthy steward i wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil i will return tomorrow said <unk>	111.20213317871094

monsieur the comte de la fere he cried i <unk> you	25.567611694335938

they halted for a minute during which he strove to collect his thoughts	30.679697036743164
athos without saying anything emptied his pockets got together all his jewels purses <unk> and gold chains and offered them all to porthos but as to the sword he said it was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master should himself quit his lodgings	150.72315979003906
d <unk> seeing him approach drew his sword a foot out of the scabbard	52.73775100708008
in the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts and children at play	216.48330688476562

it is true that this provincial was a gascon and that particularly at this period the compatriots of d <unk> had the reputation of not being easily intimidated	78.72840118408203
immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun and the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice enemies	107.818115234375
dantès was beside himself with joy	27.798297882080078
milady reclining in an armchair near the chimney beautiful pale and resigned looked like a holy virgin awaiting martyrdom	148.65481567382812

monsieur de beaufort was at supper but he rose quickly on hearing the two friends announced	113.24388122558594
his mouth was large and the lips which had not yet regained their color were particularly thin in fact the deep and crafty look giving a predominant expression to the child s face belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young	136.45529174804688
whilst supper is being prepared he said smiling you will not my friend be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared <unk> true monsieur le comte replied d <unk> who felt that by degrees athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him	109.79151153564453
and so my friends we return to paris	61.219818115234375

athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings	41.11043167114258
in such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme carelessness	66.70498657226562
their connection could not last long without ruining both	704.13232421875
steel is for <unk> and seizing the butcher by the throat porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single <unk> porthos raised his terrible fist which whistled through the air like a sling and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the <unk> s skull and crushed it	61.074554443359375
then he offered us our liberty and we accepted it	88.78980255126953
my mother gave it him and as she did so looked whiter than the marble against which she leaned	90.3796157836914

all this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the recital	127.76505279541016
they waited for ten minutes during which time no noise was heard that might indicate that grimaud was discovered and at the expiration of that anxious interval the two men returned closed the door after them and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights disappeared	73.9708023071289

athos whose acquaintance i made about that period and porthos who had in addition to my lessons taught me some effective tricks of fence prevailed upon me to solicit the uniform of a musketeer	89.19692993164062
having escaped these dangers they returned by the main road to boulogne at abbeville and followed it step by step examining every track	181.224853515625

the name he pronounced in a voice of tenderness amounting almost to love was that of haydée	117.48030853271484
he therefore drew near to the table and took the second glass	32.16852569580078
the first glance which maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with delight	150.49900817871094

the sword and he jumped off his horse	24.607126235961914
as to d <unk> being at bottom a prudent youth instead of returning home went and dined with the gascon priest who at the time of the distress of the four friends had given them a breakfast of chocolate	77.08231353759766

no accident has happened to him none <unk> and he lives still at the hotel of the great <unk> and passes his time sometimes with the queen of england sometimes with madame de chevreuse	64.4899673461914
questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made dantès indignant for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abbé a love and respect equal to his own	68.46199798583984
it is some time since we heard from his mistress said athos in a low voice	28.72743034362793
he insisted upon it declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice the other wished	117.01765441894531
everything appeared as <unk> precious <unk> in its place and the key in the <unk>	55.73731994628906
i would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to <unk> entirely beyond your control and which in no degree diminish my regard for <unk> would wish to know if they have not in some measure contributed to render you a stranger to the world in which your fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous figure sir returned the young man with a reassurance of manner make your mind easy on this score	89.31839752197266
a mournful answer awaited each of edmond s eager inquiries as to the information jacopo had obtained	167.09910583496094
it was thus athos found at home resources which he did not expect	98.14681243896484
one does not hit the bull <unk> every time it is something to hit inside the ring	101.74410247802734

orders were given that no drum should be beaten no trumpet sounded	342.3851013183594
when he had perused the documents an indefinable expression of pleasure lighted up his countenance and looking at the major with a most peculiar smile he said in very excellent tuscan then there is no longer any such thing in italy as being condemned to the galleys the major drew himself up to his full height	85.10609436035156
they carried him through an alley up a flight of stairs and deposited him in an antechamber	57.48912048339844
yes it is one of milady s bastards you laugh <unk> from habit that is all	116.03445434570312

d <unk> and <unk> and the two grooms then mounted their horses and all four started off at a quick trot to rejoin raoul and his companion	58.63836669921875
this astonishment was doubled when aramis saw athos fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former enthusiasm	78.00827026367188
mount my lord said d <unk> to mazarin who sprang into the carriage without waiting for a second bidding	31.654239654541016

it was nearly three days since i had eaten or drunk anything	64.0301284790039
andrea paid no attention to the successive charges which were brought against him	34.05095291137695
certainly there are people whom i love	55.90703582763672
however as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever mordaunt s foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left hand	87.98112487792969
oh how bitter a fate is mine to serve either as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself while my only friend and supporter is a living corpse	120.3931884765625
there she made a fresh sign of silence and opened a second door concealed by tapestry	88.86248779296875
lord de winter tore his hair	13.105193138122559
i was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation that i am sure i was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude i feel toward you	100.44689178466797
monte cristo looked at her with an emotion that must have been remarked by morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the vessel	57.7227668762207
but we must not lose time	181.3126678466797
to this cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him that he had his own horses and carriages and that not having come together it would not be difficult for them to leave separately	92.76039123535156
you see now why i did not care to know your gentleman in the mask for really in spite of his excellent intentions i could not thank him for what he has <unk> mordaunt bowed humbly	79.71342468261719
i paused but i had already drunk half a glass	55.28276443481445
i am afraid that what was first done was unskillful if not worse than useless	205.36131286621094
<unk> had not intended starting so late or he would have remained he put his head out and asked the <unk> how long it would be before they reached the next town	85.96034240722656
planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank down	106.26956939697266
albert understood the allusion in a moment and was about to throw his glove at the count when morrel seized his hand while beauchamp and <unk> fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge held him back	64.95867156982422
but were you not on horseback	67.72355651855469
come take the lantern and let us visit the garden you are not afraid of ghosts with me i hope <unk> raised the lantern and obeyed	61.88008117675781
that depends upon the sentiments with which you may inspire me. then today <unk> oh today i am no further than <unk> ah	73.89676666259766
sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success but internally he was deeply wounded and his self-love immensely piqued to think that albert de <unk> the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his pains	117.09686279296875
he saw nothing he had no knife or sharp instrument the window grating was of iron but he had too often assured himself of its solidity	120.90882873535156
wait a minute longer and i will introduce him to <unk> there followed between these two personages a strange silence during which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching	85.46946716308594
having reached the summit of a rock he saw a thousand feet beneath him his companions whom jacopo had rejoined and who were all busy preparing the repast which edmond s skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish	122.72974395751953

men fell around him as they had fallen at <unk> or at lerida	54.18744659423828
you think so do you and he took his friend along the alley where a number of tracks like those which had trampled down the flowerbeds were visible	105.49356842041016
i have never before been at paris and it is the first time i have ever even set my foot in <unk> ah that is different the house you purchase is at <unk> at these words <unk> turned pale	70.50700378417969
bowed down with fatigue she was indeed confined to her bed and it was in her own room and from the lips of madame de villefort that she heard all the strange events we have related we mean the flight of eugénie and the arrest of andrea cavalcanti or rather benedetto together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him	72.24378967285156
<unk> motioned that he had nothing more to say	34.98025131225586
de winter took us to the house of a spaniard who he said had become naturalized as an englishman by the guineas of his new compatriots	32.802024841308594
in that case commanded comminges silence that old <unk> ah	161.31588745117188
while monsieur d <unk> gave orders for the horses to be made ready for departure the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the house and saw in the direction of <unk> and of lens a large body of infantry and cavalry	39.98870086669922
let them take my fortune i am already too rich and perhaps when they have taken it they will leave me in peace and quietness	62.33478927612305

and they pursued their road in mournful silence	123.04405212402344
i shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to <unk> and who is this witness or rather this enemy asked the count in a tone in which there was a visible alteration	66.38966369628906
monsieur the comte de la fere whose family is allied to the montmorency and the rohan is easily the equal of monsieur de <unk> no matter said d <unk> in his most wheedling tone	31.220407485961914
poor fellow remarked <unk> affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart	29.502309799194336
it was evident that she had shared the grief of the family for she was pale and looked fatigued	51.49588394165039
