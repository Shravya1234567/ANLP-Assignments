is that not true monsieur <unk>	54.180328369140625
dantès cast from solitude into the world frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude and what solitude is more complete or more poetical than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night in the silence of immensity and under the eye of heaven	210.5756378173828
not a penny of what i possess will pass into your hands	170.4994354248047

now give me the cardinal up here if he makes any noise stifle <unk> mazarin wished to call out but porthos held him tight and passed him to d <unk> who seized him by the neck and made him sit down by him then in a menacing tone he said sir	166.09886169433594
twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had glanced at luigi and each time she saw that he was pale and that his features were agitated once even the blade of his knife half drawn from its sheath had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare	239.33900451660156
it was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girl s mind as to the reality of the scene her eyes started with terror her hands trembled and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her	135.78855895996094
we will not expose your eminence to the chances of <unk> come answered mazarin i see it will be necessary for me to <unk> before a siege yes the conditions will be better than <unk> ah my lord	89.93565368652344

a true friend s eloquence is so powerful my lord that you have reassured me	139.81011962890625
as to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first thought	200.9808807373047
nay do not press my hand edmond you are thinking i am sure of some kind speech to console me but do not utter it to me reserve it for others more worthy of your kindness	175.65097045898438
the woman s hood was pulled down and the man held a handkerchief to his face	57.88260269165039
andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances	47.26044845581055
on entering the courtyard of the old chateau the first person seen by our ambassador was maitre <unk> in person who standing on the threshold awaited news of his vanished master	446.5841369628906
there is but one favor i would entreat of <unk> <unk> guard carefully the secret of your birth	379.46783447265625
but as if to contradict his statement at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation while a sudden gust of wind mingled with rain extinguished the lamp he held in his hand	237.23402404785156
haste to him and warn him cried the wounded man if he still lives warn his friends too	336.77197265625
when i leave him i place in my stead a bold fellow who aspires to be his majesty s special guard	331.98016357421875
we must go replied villefort offering his arm	112.88809967041016
edmond listened intently an hour passed two hours passed and no sound was heard from the <unk> was silent there	101.98448181152344
why the man must owe me a fearful <unk> does his action appear like that of an enemy no certainly <unk> well <unk> and so he is in paris <unk> and what effect does he produce why said albert he was talked about for a week then the <unk> of the queen of england took place followed by the theft of mademoiselle <unk> s diamonds and so people talked of something <unk> my good fellow said <unk> the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly	154.11656188964844
but for this precaution which it will be remembered the abbé had made to edmond the misfortune would have been still greater for their attempt to escape would have been detected and they would undoubtedly have been separated	138.6926727294922
so then said he the letter was true to the end did you doubt it my dear monsieur bartolomeo no indeed certainly not a good man a man holding religious office as does the abbé busoni could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke but your excellency has not read <unk> ah true said monte cristo there is a <unk> yes yes repeated the major <unk> in order to save major cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker i send him a draft for 2,000 francs to <unk> his travelling expenses and credit on you for the further sum of 48,000 francs which you still owe me. the major awaited the conclusion of the postscript apparently with great anxiety	203.74530029296875
meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which d <unk> in raising the shutters had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the window	167.38075256347656
but first barricade the first door well then we will follow yonder <unk> the two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room as not only to make the passage impassable but so to block the door that by no means could it open inward	194.76307678222656
i will run to monsieur de <unk> to tell them all this and will meet them <unk> very well monsieur said planchet	51.2623176574707
he knit his brows and went direct to the tapestry which he pushed aside	151.10995483398438
but with such men it is not the sword that should be employed it is the <unk> buckingham had left england the day before sent as ambassador to spain to demand the hand of the <unk> for king charles i. who was then only prince of wales	125.01187133789062
thus then the young men made no attempt at resistance but blindly and <unk> surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors	711.972900390625
is that your opinion d <unk> yes said aramis we have <unk> then continued athos we have another reason it is <unk> in france at this moment everything is poor and paltry	106.50027465820312
