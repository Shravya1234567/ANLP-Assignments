the clerks who as it appeared had smelled unusual perfumes in the house were of military punctuality and held their stools in hand quite ready to sit down	407.2142028808594
i have sent for one replied the abbé	29.54500961303711
though his coming was announced in a very low tone madame de <unk> arose from her pillow	106.97167205810547

at three of the clock the sound of fireworks let off on the piazza del popolo and the piazza di venezia heard with difficulty amid the din and confusion announced that the races were about to begin	83.5914306640625
now said <unk> lowering his voice and looking into every corner of the apartment to see if they were alone now let us talk about yourself my young friend for it is evident that your happy return has something to do with the joy of the king the triumph of the queen and the humiliation of his eminence	51.77153396606445

i love retirement and silence because i can live with my thoughts and recollections of past days	379.80780029296875
the young men then rose and bowing to the count quitted the room	56.86713790893555
there they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties the <unk> was in truth the everlasting enemy of the patron of <unk> jeune <unk>	86.43771362304688

dantès himself only knew that which personally concerned him for he never beheld again the five persons i have named to you or heard mention of anyone of <unk> well when dantès was arrested monsieur morrel hastened to obtain the particulars and they were very sad	264.5121154785156
the count was asked what time he required to prepare his defence	81.83808898925781
he waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour half an hour <unk> change took place	57.791290283203125
he found the door of his passage open sprang up the stairs and knocked softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey	123.88137817382812
he aimed a terrible blow at d <unk> who avoided it by springing to one side but by this movement he left a passage free to the bandit who darted off toward the bastion	161.9059600830078
well what good wind blows you hither at this hour said he have you come to sup with me	143.50762939453125

the sea was calm and with a fresh breeze from the <unk> they sailed beneath a bright blue sky in which god also lighted up in turn his beacon lights each of which is a world	244.27867126464844
happily for him he has ceased to bear that <unk> and therefore said d <unk> resolved to be patient to the end it is not aramis i seek but the abbé d <unk>	83.33389282226562

morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m. de villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands the stiff neck and the purple lips	94.03592681884766
all his furniture consisted of a bed a chair a table a pail and a jug	264.6012878417969
after a moment s mournful silence his heart overflowed and he gave way to a flood of tears	110.95271301269531
yes <unk> you have not been long <unk> no	40.399986267089844
he remained there ten minutes motionless and dumb listening to the beating of his own heart	116.6290512084961
thank god i am not a bravo	133.16287231445312
then m. de <unk> unwilling that it should be thought that he had influenced the wounded man requested m. de la <unk> to interrogate him himself	60.348514556884766
besides the pleasure there is always remorse from the indulgence of our passions and after all what have you men to fear from all this	137.1261444091797

m. and madame de villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that valentine should be summoned to her grandfather s presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the <unk> spirit of the invalid	95.14175415039062

the <unk> <unk> in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded still franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another	308.1123352050781

my faith said d <unk> it appears that i was more drunk than you since i remember nothing of the <unk> athos did not trust this reply and he resumed you can not have failed to remark my dear friend that everyone has his particular kind of drunkenness sad or gay	100.11226654052734
did he allude to his hope of being captain he spoke of it as a thing already <unk> indeed said <unk> he is in too much hurry it appears to me. why it seems m. morrel has promised him the <unk> so that he is quite elated about it why yes he is actually insolent over the <unk> already offered me his patronage as if he were a grand personage and proffered me a loan of money as though he were a <unk> which you refused most assuredly although i might easily have accepted it for it was i who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned but now m. dantès has no longer any occasion for <unk> is about to become a <unk> pooh said <unk> he is not one <unk> <unk> foi it will be as well if he is not answered <unk> for if he should be there will be really no speaking to <unk> if we choose replied <unk> he will remain what he is and perhaps become even less than he <unk> what do you mean <unk> was speaking to myself	126.08135986328125

athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of conversation	171.30857849121094
they rode on in this way for ten minutes	58.781558990478516
it has four hundred lines and lasts a <unk> my faith my dear aramis said d <unk> who detested verses almost as much as he did latin add to the merit of the difficulty that of the <unk> and you are sure that your poem will at least have two <unk> you will see continued aramis that it <unk> irreproachable passion	164.50515747070312

if you do not believe that it is my father say so immediately and if on the contrary you believe it to be him state your reasons for doing so. beauchamp looked at albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him and which in its numerous <unk> served to express every varied emotion of his mind	130.7032012939453
monte cristo wrote i die murdered by the corsican benedetto my comrade in the galleys at toulon no	405.1304016113281
but athos rose likewise drew his sword and placed himself in the way	54.930419921875
d <unk> took advantage of the circumstance to find a place in the hedge not so thick where his glance could penetrate to the supposed cavalier	135.96310424804688
will you go up with me i follow <unk> monte cristo entered the tower which was divided into three stories	77.2016830444336

a weak obstacle is sometimes sufficient to <unk> a great design	451.3123779296875
now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a <unk> but asked franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french sardinian or tuscan governments why said gaetano with a smile	285.860595703125
when he believed that the right moment had arrived he took the knife <unk> open the teeth which offered less resistance than before counted one after the other twelve drops and watched the phial contained perhaps twice as much more	288.16058349609375
now albert said he you understand <unk> you not	69.47237396240234

dantès thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land	82.45529174804688
it is for that reason i am delighted to see you continued the abbé although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation which if it succeeded would possibly change <unk> s system	97.2848129272461

in truth that the red simar which occupied the <unk> place was his no longer was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living <unk> the corridors deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with <unk> that spirit of bitter ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very <unk> of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city <unk> against the minister as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns <unk> off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards the swiss troops and the military who surrounded the palais royal that the people were possessed of arms	385.1474304199219

our gascon promised this without risk for he knew all that was meant	182.35748291015625
athos and his friends again mingling with the throng were taking a last look at the martyr king	207.0184783935547

on looking around him however as he could perceive no threatening object as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger as the bench was comfortably covered with a <unk> cushion as the wall was ornamented with a beautiful <unk> leather and as large red damask curtains fastened back by gold clasps floated before the window he perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated and he began to turn his head to the right and the left upward and <unk>	195.63885498046875
his reserve his roughness and his silence made almost an old man of him	278.4696960449219

he hoped then in a conversation with anne of austria to obtain some information from that conversation and afterward to come upon his eminence with some secret which the cardinal either knew or did not know but which in either case would raise him infinitely in the eyes of his minister	136.310791015625
pardon me i love him so much these two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace	121.55726623535156
at the footman s announcement she raised herself a little and peeped out with some curiosity	131.5463409423828
this idea imparted new energy and in three days he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the <unk>	242.8995819091797
he placed the casket on the table then opening it took out a little golden box the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring	119.67201232910156

from his windows he saw all the visitors who were caught	188.1890106201172
he who at the moment occupied the upper step kept his adversaries marvelously in check	315.7830505371094
as he found himself in the quarter in which aramis lived he took it into his head to pay his friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to send planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the mousetrap	72.78910064697266
he stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted	41.4281005859375
the world is a sepulcher alas you will find it so yourself said aramis with a sigh	68.53362274169922
i beg you will remove your <unk> it may be supposed then franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission but took off the handkerchief and found himself in the presence of a man from <unk> to forty years of age dressed in a <unk> costume that is to say a red cap with a long blue silk <unk> a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold pantaloons of deep red large and full gaiters of the same color embroidered with gold like the vest and yellow slippers he had a splendid cashmere round his waist and a small sharp and crooked <unk> was passed through his girdle	95.86660766601562

while we are forgetting them they are falling into their appointed order and when again our attention is directed to them we are surprised at the progress they have made towards the proposed end	289.6932678222656

the queen pressed her brother and the emperor of austria to appear to be wounded as they really were by the policy of <unk> eternal object of which was the <unk> of the house of <unk> declare war against france and as a condition of peace to insist upon the dismissal of the cardinal but as to love there was not a single word about it in all the letter	95.76335144042969
the nations took <unk> who was doomed to destroy them for a conqueror similar to other conquerors and it was necessary for both to reveal their <unk> that they might be known and acknowledged one was compelled to say i am the angel of the lord and the other i am the hammer of god in order that the divine essence in both might be <unk> then said villefort more and more amazed and really supposing he was speaking to a <unk> or a madman you consider yourself as one of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned and why not said monte cristo coldly	189.10400390625
grimaud turned round with a <unk> recognized me and pointed to the man in the mask	90.92288208007812

he was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age of <unk> countenance <unk> to his superiors insolent to his subordinates and this in addition to his position as responsible agent on board which is always <unk> to the sailors made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond dantès was beloved by them	116.01271057128906
but first barricade the first door well then we will follow yonder <unk> the two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room as not only to make the passage impassable but so to block the door that by no means could it open inward	236.34823608398438
it is true we plundered them a little when we took them and i will even confess that it is their purse that monsieur du vallon and i draw on in our nightly play	179.37744140625
at times he thought of those brave french gentlemen who had appeared to him from a distance of a hundred leagues fabulous and <unk> like the forms that appear in dreams	169.99610900878906
a few hundred yards beyond the town d <unk> drew rein	118.41876220703125

then we must fly said he	48.68373489379883

as to the because which was near making milady lose her credit with the cardinal kitty knew nothing about it but this time d <unk> was better informed than she was	174.6066436767578

then in that chamber which recalled to him so many royal <unk> whither had come so many courtiers the scene of so much flattering homage alone with a despairing servant whose feeble soul could afford no support to his own the king at last yielded to sorrow and his courage sank to a level with that feebleness those shadows and that wintry cold	407.0093994140625
the face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the paper	70.9743881225586

from a distance dantès recognized the <unk> and handling of <unk> jeune <unk> and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the <unk> he met his companions with an assurance that although considerably better than when they quitted him he still suffered <unk> from his late accident	233.7858123779297
the officer desired to have milady s packages pointed out to him and ordered them to be placed in the boat	97.3413314819336

the accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon had been employed	149.85153198242188
ah i remember athos is at monsieur de <unk> s. but where are you going monsieur where are you going i am going down by the window in order to be there the sooner cried d <unk>	56.356101989746094

and thus they parted the best possible friends and m. de <unk> even wished to take him to the chamber to hear the <unk> the countess made no reply	64.52598571777344
instead of returning then by the saint honore gate d <unk> who had time before him walked around and re-entered by the porte richelieu	174.1180877685547
and what is your choice asked <unk>	43.433677673339844

you asked me just now if i was in funds said d <unk> placing some twenty <unk> upon the table	95.15313720703125
how very astonishing cried he at length	120.2425308227539

yes yes mazarin continued whilst his <unk> smile full of <unk> lent a strange expression to his pale lips yes these noises prove to me indeed that the destiny of favorites is precarious but ye shall know i am no ordinary favorite	438.4891052246094

the host drew back and burst into tears	114.5941162109375

dantès dived again and remained a long time beneath the water	126.64378356933594
this time there could be no doubt d <unk> was really insulted	53.72979736328125
i always said that d <unk> had the longest head of the four said athos who having uttered his opinion to which d <unk> replied with a bow immediately resumed his accustomed silence	111.52132415771484
in the first place said athos let us leave this chamber the dead are not agreeable company particularly when they have died a violent <unk> planchet said d <unk> i commit the corpse of this poor devil to your care	110.18647766113281

besides the woman wore that black mantle which d <unk> could still see outlined on the shutter of the rue de vaugirard and on the door of the rue de la harpe still further the man wore the uniform of a musketeer	59.729759216308594

you are examining my den said aramis	166.53074645996094
then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered	246.0317840576172
it need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender it reaches then quite naturally the highest <unk> of which it is capable	137.69935607910156

battles long journeys blows given and received sufficed for the first <unk> of conversation which turned upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the great cardinal	500.45703125
a moment after <unk> s face appeared at the grating in the door	61.22340774536133
and instantly grimaud sitting upon the board as if on horseback commenced his perilous descent	449.1423645019531

at two of the clock i shall have the honor of expecting you at the hôtel of monsieur de <unk>	19.58633041381836

who will support them a shudder ran through the young man s frame	104.39077758789062
he is an upstart a man of no name who will only be the tool of a party in france	69.04515838623047
then he became alarmed and dared not stay any longer at nîmes so he solicited a change of residence and as he was in reality very influential he was <unk> to versailles	188.8688201904297

it remains now for us to keep our word	102.4097671508789
one of them preceded the rest by double the length of his horse	199.9049530029297
in which it is proved that first impulses are oftentimes the best	59.99856948852539
felton made a sign that she should not be disturbed and when all was arranged he went out quietly with the soldiers	51.41606521606445

in <unk> me you have fallen into the trap yourselves	357.27496337890625

the blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side of the executioner	51.28837203979492

the <unk> had remained on the shore of the lake ready to cover our retreat they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others in case of pursuit	126.43916320800781

carmela wished to form a quadrille but there was one lady wanting	598.4174194335938

this is the case said d <unk> this is your brother madeleine you do not know him perhaps but i know him he has arrived from amsterdam	77.54146575927734
