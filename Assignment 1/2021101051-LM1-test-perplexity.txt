that little man in black that you upset at the corner of saint jean cemetery that is the man my dear fellow he was an annoyance to the cardinal	89.71558380126953
it was thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the beautiful and proud anne of austria and in making himself loved by dazzling her	307.4124755859375
all eyes were turned towards this <unk> to all except athos he was unknown	187.35971069335938

on their road they perceived lord winter marching at the head of his regiment	251.55252075195312
a leather pocketbook a purse in which was evidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received with a dice box and dice completed the possessions of the dead man	193.9307098388672

all that however has nothing to do with my obligations to you and i now come to ask you whether in my own person my family or connections i can in any way serve you	101.84491729736328

a regiment of cuirassiers nearly equal as to numbers issued from behind the hill and came full gallop toward it	525.7462768554688
she gave the first to athos and the other to aramis so that should they be separated by chance they might make themselves known to the king after which they withdrew	185.7112579345703
i thought you were <unk> a living in tuscany or piedmont by acting as <unk> or <unk> and i pitied you sincerely as i would a child of my own	161.62632751464844

he looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued and having reached it he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone	289.67340087890625
she thought that lord de winter had hastened her departure she thought she was condemned to set off that very evening	83.0587387084961
as to my arms it is useless to trouble you about them i have <unk> a horse for your lackey resumed the procurator s wife <unk> but that is doing things in lordly style my <unk> ah madame said porthos haughtily do you take me for a beggar no i only thought that a pretty mule makes sometimes as good an appearance as a horse and it seemed to me that by getting a pretty mule for <unk> well agreed for a pretty mule said porthos you are right i have seen very great spanish nobles whose whole suite were mounted on <unk>	164.31521606445312
during this time dantès at the opposite side of the table had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests	291.71795654296875

then he has neither the parliament nor the people with <unk> represent the wealth of the country nor the nobles nor the princes who are the military power of <unk> d <unk> scratched his ear	246.68447875976562
what do you want of me she asked in great distress	89.92943572998047
my first care was to run to the door he had left the key in it taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock	119.09329986572266
unfortunately he was an honorable man he married her	181.7438201904297
with it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night and then supper sinbad hashish statues <unk> became a dream for franz	442.7267761230469
their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages	184.6231231689453
it is true she speculates with her own money not mine nevertheless you can understand that when 700,000 francs leave the wife s pocket the husband always finds it out	668.3096923828125
behind this group walked the surgeon and behind the surgeon the door closed	243.3720245361328
he was superintending the grooming of his horse and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden when the count s carriage stopped at the gate	48.8129768371582
we have a rendezvous you remember at the place <unk> ah	71.9363784790039
you would follow the escort exclaimed porthos in dismay	300.184326171875
no only add two bottles of champagne and the difference will be for the <unk> the host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for but he made amends by slipping in two bottles of anjou wine instead of two bottles of champagne	205.95590209960938
he looked for his doublet of the year <unk> and as he had <unk> habits he found it hanging on its nail	251.99371337890625
and you assisted and took part in this great battle <unk> cried the former musketeer	317.31982421875
i consult them when doubtful and if i ever do any good it is due to their beneficent counsels	628.2132568359375
the young man was already dressed and was reading a new book by m. <unk>	100.0619125366211
the king quite delighted inquired if the cardinal was still at the louvre he was told that his eminence awaited the orders of his majesty in the business cabinet	94.85112762451172
it was to that obedience i owe her <unk> d <unk> was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the destinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended	414.0120849609375
he addressed himself then to porthos to gain information respecting athos and aramis and to aramis in order to learn something of porthos	131.44659423828125
you know the marquis of <unk> died a few days after he had set out on his journey to paris and the marchioness a few days after her arrival yes said monte cristo i have heard that but as <unk> said to hamlet it is a law of nature their fathers died before them and they mourned their loss they will die before their children who will in their turn grieve for <unk> but that is not <unk> not all no they were going to marry their <unk> to m. franz d <unk>	106.61134338378906
before daybreak m. de <unk> must take his departure still in obscurity	219.3588409423828
the thin spare man <unk> the executioner in short asked aramis	136.8390655517578
wait it ought to be there in my pocket it speaks of his return does it not porthos all gascon as he was d <unk> could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood	192.73309326171875
has your husband any spanish bonds he asked of the baroness	363.85491943359375
the young man rang the bell violently the <unk> who had been in mademoiselle valentine s room and the servant who had replaced barrois ran in at the same moment	86.70413208007812
at their approach planchet came out leading the two horses	132.4492950439453
i have dined many times with him and the count of <unk> so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate them a little we might meet in the same <unk> come your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong <unk> that is all very fine benedetto <unk> but i know what i am saying	109.43618774414062
he is my friend and this morning offered to share his money with me as i shared mine with him	211.31414794921875
never mind renée replied the marquise with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features but however all other feelings may be withered in a woman s nature there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart and that is the <unk> of maternal love	194.2487030029297
i had no such contempt for men <unk> was i not a good ambassador in france yes for mazarin has granted what i <unk> have i not always fought for your glory and interests too ardently perhaps it is what i have just reproached you for	278.80609130859375
twenty minutes twenty tedious minutes passed thus then ten more and at last the clock struck the half-hour	583.5909423828125
it appeared however to milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening	114.66200256347656
for more than a month past the mischievous child who knew not what to wish for had taken it into his head to have a monkey	175.36526489257812
then the hand was withdrawn leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring	155.185546875
in this state of mutual understanding they reached leghorn	1754.1988525390625
thanks to what aramis had told him d <unk> who knew already that porthos called himself du vallon was now aware that he styled himself from his estate de <unk> and that he was on account of this estate engaged in a <unk> with the bishop of noyon	128.4113006591797
let me know what crime i have committed	83.22293853759766
when she was only about three steps from him he turned his head round fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red cushion who had risen and was approaching followed by her black boy and her woman	123.23841857910156
further this woman as if not certain of the house she was seeking lifted up her eyes to look around her stopped went backward and then returned again	151.2122344970703
pardon me monsieur but you are <unk> my lord the duke of buckingham said mme	23.889694213867188
an explanation at the opera said the count with that calm tone and penetrating eye which <unk> the man who knows his because is good	133.47030639648438
the next morning he gathered an <unk> of pieces of slate and began	400.36334228515625
leaning against the tree he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little house	284.76593017578125
ali returned a sign in the negative	44.07551574707031
the three friends looked on panting and astonished	411.6981201171875
you are right sir said raoul	7.792495250701904
then <unk> sat astride the <unk> and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall then he began to descend or rather to <unk> down by the two <unk> which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the exercise	92.59648132324219
what must be done then asked the <unk> i have my carriage here said the president	56.420528411865234
one morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him when grimaud entered and seeing what was going on approached the duke respectfully but took the guard by the arm	130.93263244628906
he feared then to see her too often	188.39523315429688
sir said aramis you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary manner	253.94239807128906
it is not of my wife i hope on the contrary it is of her	41.29331970214844
besides the manner in which beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart	247.9982147216797
i demand the suppression of the <unk> since then continued aramis i have lived very agreeably	238.22885131835938
people die very suddenly in your house m. de <unk> what cried the magistrate with an accent of horror and consternation are you still <unk> on that terrible idea still sir and i shall always do so replied d <unk> for it has never for one instant ceased to retain possession of my mind and that you may be quite sure i am not mistaken this time listen well to what i am going to say m. de <unk> the magistrate trembled convulsively	90.3741455078125
his costume of guardsman in the company of m. <unk> ought to be his passport	52.97433853149414
d <unk> i have always loved you as my son porthos we slept six years side by side aramis is your brother as well as mine and aramis has once loved you as i love you now and as i have ever loved you	244.2795867919922
involuntarily his languid eyes closed and still through his eyelashes a well-known form seemed to move amid the obscurity with which he thought himself enveloped	288.16717529296875
had not villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter the only proof against him	304.95794677734375
everything goes as if in flowery <unk> everything goes too well porthos	560.2178344726562
i wrote the word <unk> at the end of the <unk> strip about a week ago	86.80792236328125
but mark the distinction with which he is treated instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which means too the amusements of the day are <unk> and there is a spectacle to please every <unk> without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing to surprise them <unk> my good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant <unk> perhaps i am but one thing i have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape solely from having served me	217.3435516357422
the fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then does it not asked <unk>	215.63087463378906
you have misunderstood me all sympathy is extinct between <unk> ingrate that you are ah	811.02392578125
i will make verses said he	40.33308792114258
at dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing rein half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell down	475.5802001953125
it is a <unk> by monsieur voiture that monsieur l abbé is repeating to me. said athos in a loud voice and i confess i think it <unk> raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the group round madame de chevreuse	156.0502471923828
then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers aloud	63.84153366088867
what is there astonishing in that and you had no other object in coming to england but to see me no. so it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the channel for you <unk> the deuce	90.93250274658203
it only remained to put it to the vote when the president resumed gentlemen and you monsieur <unk> will not be displeased i presume to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness and who has just presented himself	157.68130493164062
have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden <unk> of my ingots	338.0154113769531
the chamber cuts down their <unk> every day so that now they have scarcely any	161.6015167236328
the table at which the puritan officers were seated was round and whether by chance or coarse intention harrison sat with his back to the king	494.0643615722656
she ran to the window and opened it	20.977033615112305
this mysterious shade spread over his whole person rendered still more interesting the man whose eyes or mouth even in the most complete intoxication had never revealed anything however skillfully questions had been put to him	477.2806091308594
it seems to me however said mazarin the safest <unk> yes for you my lord but not for the queen you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the <unk> <unk> or find some one else continued d <unk> turning his back	114.45682525634766
stop gentlemen said albert i have two words to say to the count of monte <unk> in private asked morrel	51.88440704345703
they are no doubt both curious and <unk> yes yes but let us go	89.79377746582031
i would lay a wager he has stolen <unk> do you think so answered d <unk> but little convinced as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cupidity	209.2552947998047
without doubt he recognized d <unk> for he became deadly pale doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his head	158.2224578857422
the dog sprang and in spite of the height jumped lightly over it	197.1343536376953
i hope my coming will not put you to any <unk> i reside in my father s house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard entirely separated from the main <unk> quite sufficient replied the count as taking out his tablets he wrote down no	179.9517822265625
at the end of a long corridor with which the door communicated and which formed the antechamber was on the right albert s <unk> looking into the court and on the left the salon looking into the garden	121.76274108886719
lord winter was seated near an aperture arranged as a window to let in the night air his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon <unk> veiled as we before observed by heavy clouds	371.34832763671875
i remember well that diamond which belonged to the <unk> you see then that i speak to you in the queen s name	45.261417388916016
without appearing to have heard the dialogue of which she had not lost a word she began again giving to her voice all the charm all the power all the seduction the demon had bestowed upon it for all my tears my cares my exile and my chains i have my youth my prayers and god who counts my <unk> her voice of immense power and sublime expression gave to the rude unpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most exalted puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren and which they were forced to ornament with all the resources of their imagination	310.30596923828125
i comprehend <unk> you comprehend said porthos	129.00436401367188
it may be imagined that d <unk> listened to these details with increasing interest before grimaud had finished he rose without noise and putting his mouth to aramis s ear and at the same time touching him on the shoulder to prevent a sudden movement chevalier he said get up and do not make the least <unk> aramis awoke	143.01223754882812
at last about ten of the clock and just as dantès began to despair steps were heard in the corridor a key turned in the lock the bolts creaked the massy oaken door flew open and a flood of light from two torches pervaded the apartment	231.9061737060547
d <unk> knew it was considered <unk> by an englishman to refuse to pledge him	133.3756866455078
you do not belong to the human species you are a demon escaped from hell whither we send you back <unk> ah you virtuous men said milady please to remember that he who shall touch a hair of my head is himself an <unk> the executioner may kill without being on that account an assassin said the man in the red cloak rapping upon his immense sword	244.51710510253906
aramis looked after them and as the last of them passed close to him he pressed the hand of athos	60.94140625
are you not the soldier fernand who deserted on the eve of the battle of waterloo	195.71295166015625
no news had been received of them only a letter all perfumed and of an elegant writing in small characters had come for aramis	399.4684143066406
lackeys who have the order to warn their masters when anyone passes are not lackeys they are <unk> your eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution we should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting you our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done us in uniting us	243.0302734375
his fears were now no longer for his hoard but for himself	177.23623657226562
the scheme goes forward it <unk> on wheels dear <unk> good	499.5122375488281
d <unk> signed to them to draw near	148.01589965820312
really said the major i am quite ashamed of the trouble i am giving <unk> pray do not mention such a thing said the count	79.22837829589844
we are not such devils as we appear to be	142.57183837890625
devil take it he muttered to himself do not let me betray my secrets to a man not inclined to entertain <unk> well then said athos what are your schemes	205.63616943359375
night had closed in and paris seen thus by the light of lanterns flickering on the <unk> of water crowded with <unk> of every kind including those that glittered with the armed patrols with the watchword passing from post to <unk> presented such an aspect as to strongly seize the senses of aramis a man most susceptible to warlike impressions	550.23193359375
is the countess up yet if you wish i will <unk> yes ask her for one of her <unk> <unk> mine is incomplete and tell her i shall have the honor of seeing her about three of the clock and that i request permission to introduce someone to <unk> the valet left the room	107.75752258300781
to my misfortune to my eternal misfortune and milady twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of grief	188.1425323486328
i must however do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one	185.67893981933594
<unk> cried milady i a protestant	1817.654052734375
you shall <unk> and dame nanette sprang to the window threw it open and in such a piercing voice that it might have been heard in the square of notre dame help she screamed my master is being arrested the councillor <unk> is being arrested	205.38473510742188
he then looked at the objects near him	234.91421508789062
he took to his heels and was soon at m. de <unk> s but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd he asked to be introduced to m. de <unk> s office	49.88189697265625
that proof satisfied him so completely that as a sign of satisfaction he has sent me as your majesty may see to consider with you what reparation should be made to gentlemen unjustly treated and wrongfully <unk> i listen to you and i wonder at you sir said the queen	155.39013671875
have i not told you already that i had nothing to do with that	63.077152252197266
in spite of his habitual silence the poor lad this time found his speech	348.1360778808594
upon gaining this advantage d <unk> was near uttering a cry of surprise it was not aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor it was a woman	79.48876190185547
the count advanced to meet him	13.286444664001465
what is it asked villefort rushing from his room	139.4988555908203
your advice then <unk> to sell the diamond replied aramis	57.384246826171875

aramis pushed his so vigorously that after going back fifty paces the man ended by fairly taking to his heels and disappeared amid the hooting of the lackeys	592.1542358398438
mother he said turning towards mercédès this is m. debray secretary of the minister for the interior once a friend of <unk> how once stammered debray what do you mean i say so m. debray because i have no friends now and i ought not to have any	177.4651641845703
so throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and <unk> air let me beg of you not to hesitate in <unk> your wishes you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of <unk> however limited are still equal to meeting the largest demands and were you even to require a <unk> i beg your pardon interposed monte cristo	158.12026977539062
listen said the young man to the sentinel	31.079071044921875
he perceived his mistake but the friends of aramis were not at all convinced by his <unk> and one of them addressed the young musketeer with affected seriousness	174.30650329589844
on the exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father the servants all fled with muttered imprecations they were heard running down the stairs and through the long passages then there was a rush in the court afterwards all was still they had one and all deserted the accursed house	300.3121643066406
be silent i will <unk> aramis accordingly took the quill reflected for a few moments wrote eight or ten lines in a charming little female hand and then with a voice soft and slow as if each word had been scrupulously weighed he read the following my lord the person who writes these few lines had the honor of crossing swords with you in the little enclosure of the rue d <unk>	234.27659606933594
under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows he prudently turned away and calmed himself immediately daunted by the power of a resolute mind	1144.502685546875
at the same instant the gun was fired and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his head	80.45275115966797
how <unk> had a narrow escape of being eaten	209.08343505859375
unfortunately the legs began to refuse their service to this bony machine	463.595458984375
with a thousand <unk> one may face everything	1100.4649658203125
alone and free to act as he wished the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern placed it on a stand then went straight to the <unk> felt the lock and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing	202.6708221435547
he had not <unk> ten minutes with the people of the tavern before he learned that a woman had come there alone about eleven of the clock the night before had engaged a chamber had sent for the master of the hôtel and told him she desired to remain some time in the neighborhood	100.85768127441406
at madame de villefort s proposition he instantly winked his eyes	265.7228088378906
it was scarcely eleven of the clock in the morning and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with m. de <unk> who could not fail to think the manner in which d <unk> had left him a little cavalier	29.48329734802246
besides this as every great action bears its recompense with it the brave <unk> of d <unk> resulted in the restoration of the <unk> he had lost	245.7264862060547
believe me the cord is more certain than the <unk> felton grew pale and made a step forward remembering that at the moment he entered milady had a rope in her hand	96.3481216430664
and you <unk> in an <unk> to eat a morsel during which i shall send for a post <unk> capital	156.27789306640625
he was dressed with all the english peculiarity namely in a blue coat with gilt buttons and high collar in the fashion of 1811 a white <unk> waistcoat and nankeen pantaloons three inches too short but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee	526.8128051757812
come come fernand said <unk> hold up your head and answer us	185.6493682861328
the prisoner heard the cry which sounded like the sob of a broken heart and leaning from the coach he called out good-bye <unk> shall soon meet again then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of fort saint nicholas	317.3980407714844
stop a moment does not that <unk> yonder just by the side of the town glitter on the <unk> this was the name given the cuirassiers whom cromwell had made his <unk>	149.2876739501953
we four have got to master these eight fools and their stupid captain	1229.6258544921875
she blushed and that she might not answer clasped her beautiful hands till her sharp nails almost pierced them	547.1405029296875
two broke from the heat of the fire the other ten were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea	243.1835174560547
during the evident preoccupation of madame de villefort monte cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms <unk> on him the most tender endearments	128.7100372314453
the man was one of those puritans half <unk> and half soldier who <unk> around cromwell	434.4825439453125
in a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent diamonds	164.575927734375
take it said she and be accursed athos took the paper returned the pistol to his belt approached the lamp to be assured that it was the paper unfolded it and read december 3 1627 it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done	126.8250732421875

god gave that spectre the form of the count of monte cristo when he at length issued from his tomb <unk> him with gold and diamonds and led him to you ah i recognize <unk> recognize you exclaimed the king s attorney you <unk> i am edmond dantès you are edmond dantès cried villefort seizing the count by the wrist then come here and up the stairs he dragged monte cristo who ignorant of what had happened followed him in astonishment foreseeing some new catastrophe	159.29348754882812
and this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all <unk> grief has stunned him replied d <unk> and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureur s study	336.06707763671875
i had not yet fully recovered consciousness when again i heard groans mingled with <unk> cries as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle	638.133544921875
i am king of all creation	402.9689025878906
monte cristo pressed his forehead on his burning hands as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its thoughts	117.7293472290039
he darted a preparatory glance at athos and aramis who slyly pushed their chairs a little back so as to leave themselves more space for action	325.45941162109375
tell them to take arms to come here and to run	280.6902770996094
i know no one but myself who is acquainted with the noble art of <unk>	105.50629425048828
he was a picard whom the glorious musketeer had picked up on the bridge <unk> making rings and <unk> in the water	283.9181213378906
the executioner let fall his mace drew his knife and with one stroke opened his throat and mounting on his stomach stamped violently on it with his feet	165.358154296875
all went well till they arrived at chantilly which they reached about eight of the clock in the morning	30.675485610961914
take this said madame de villefort giving her <unk> to valentine	36.292015075683594
who would ever have thought it d <unk> only sighed	160.47288513183594
what made you choose a house at the gates of paris m. <unk> i cried the steward with a strange expression	68.9810562133789
and as a proof of what i say she commanded me to show you this diamond which she thinks you <unk> and so saying mazarin extended his hand to the officer who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the hotel de ville and which she had <unk> from monsieur des <unk>	90.84040832519531
you have not played for a long time i said you ought then to have a good <unk> well what then well the englishman and his companion are still here	82.95610046386719
at ten of the clock every one was in his appointed position at half-past ten the prince visited the posts and gave his final orders for the following day	195.95489501953125

athos waved his flag turning his back on the guards of the city and saluting those of the camp	99.2078857421875
frightful murmured athos while porthos broke the bottles and aramis gave orders a little too late that a confessor should be sent for	134.0616455078125
one of those three members was the coachman who had driven them there	238.2640838623047
morrel farewell do you leave me yes i have business in italy	59.29487609863281
in the meantime anne of austria approached comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by d <unk> and porthos	92.61957550048828
after having sought for a few minutes he stopped at a leaf which had several notes and compared them with the deed of sale which lay on the table and recalling his <unk> auteuil rue de la fontaine no	134.7843475341797
we may like <unk> delight in whist be <unk> with <unk> and yet grow tired of them all but we always come back to <unk> is not only a game it is a <unk> <unk>	235.4566650390625
i am for you not only a protector but a friend not only a benefactor but a father	166.0104217529297
and of what malady it is feared that it may be the smallpox sir replied porthos desirous of taking his turn in the conversation and what is serious is that it will certainly spoil his <unk> the smallpox	242.9558868408203
i had well concerted my plans pursued aramis the coadjutor gave me sixty men twenty guard the walls of the park twenty the road from rueil to saint germain twenty are dispersed in the woods	401.69122314453125
in the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room where they took counsel together	292.3829345703125
and is he still in love with the <unk> over head and ears but unless i am much mistaken there will be a storm in that <unk> <unk> explain <unk> why should i it is more important than you think perhaps	132.23373413085938
how i have suffered said milady in that harmonious voice which like that of the ancient <unk> charmed all whom she wished to destroy	227.48666381835938
he questioned her with his eyes but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look	174.3766632080078
in a few minutes a night watch passed	1086.348876953125
he again ran back to the château	20.602670669555664
and having done so entirely on my own account be it understood i would add that i believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with yanina	273.34075927734375
i live because it is not ordained for me to die	24.104114532470703
<unk> s hands still grasped the gold and <unk> and la <unk> called up her sweetest smiles while welcoming the reappearance of their guest	401.52020263671875
we can watch the <unk> and if he does not go straight i will crush him that is <unk> well said porthos replied d <unk>	37.30671310424805
<unk> for whom france was a vast <unk> from which <unk> <unk> knights and queens were to disappear so that the king was <unk>	182.42095947265625
well said she hardly giving franz time to sit down it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new lord ruthven and you are already the best friends in the <unk> without being so far advanced as that my dear countess returned franz i can not deny that we have abused his good nature all <unk> all day yes this morning we breakfasted with him we rode in his carriage all day and now we have taken possession of his <unk> you know him then yes and no. how so it is a long <unk> tell it to me. it would frighten you too <unk> so much the more <unk> at least wait until the story has a <unk> very well i prefer complete <unk> but tell me how you made his acquaintance	137.60398864746094
i was just beginning the soup and you will dine with me. oh oh said d <unk> <unk> has not caught these bottles with his lasso	127.84537506103516
monte cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of ali pasha and knowing everything he had advised <unk> to write to yanina	86.83843994140625
<unk> ran thither hearing the noise	33.871498107910156
d <unk> was again in the presence of the circe who had before surrounded him with her <unk>	63.83767318725586
d <unk> turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces off	214.2425537109375
to the wall to the wall and the four friends <unk> by grimaud pushed with the barrels of their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall which bent as if pushed by the wind and <unk> itself from its base fell with a horrible crash into the ditch	117.8800048828125
and why is it impossible because monsieur de beaufort is one of my friends or rather i am one of his	51.06099319458008
if i mistake not you are an admirer of paintings at least i judged so from the attention you appeared to be bestowing on mine when i entered the room	317.94427490234375
a ground floor ornamented with arabesques bathing its <unk> in the water and another floor looking on the lake was all which was visible to the eye	375.3755798339844
a quarter of an hour later he was with the marshal	46.038448333740234
i wished to live said athos	18.156862258911133
well said d <unk> one is never killed in a first <unk> nor in the second said aramis nor in the third returned porthos and even when one is killed one rises again the proof of which is that here we are no said athos it is not raoul about whom i am anxious for i trust he will conduct himself like a gentleman and if he is <unk> he will die bravely but <unk> such a misfortune <unk> athos passed his hand across his pale brow	157.0706024169922
however the two culprits advanced and as they approached their faces became visible	205.76016235351562
then you are ignorant of what has become of your wife since her <unk> absolutely monseigneur but she has most likely returned to the <unk> at one of the clock this morning she had not <unk> my god	65.53368377685547
five minutes later he was in the rue des <unk>	15.233612060546875
the day however passed away and the evening came on slowly but finally it came	230.01722717285156
he might be recognized not only by these signs but also from the accent with which he spoke to the <unk> as a frenchman	81.55638885498047
come calm yourself and reckon them <unk>	274.1807556152344
he was seeking in his mind then for the least awkward means of retreat when he remarked that aramis had let his handkerchief fall and by mistake no doubt had placed his foot upon it	230.80938720703125
the latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death would you assassinate me sir	63.17359161376953
mademoiselle de villefort took from the hands of barrois who was sent out the lemonade which m. <unk> had every morning and he has escaped by a miracle	114.92003631591797
i rushed towards the staircase clutching my hair and uttering a groan of horror	143.16636657714844
help cried a voice whose mournful accents reaching the four friends seemed to proceed from some phantom of the ocean	482.01519775390625
everything that savors of mystery charms them	7590.10595703125
now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet says	179.3213348388672
the cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him	127.73709869384766
during this passage felton related everything to <unk> instead of going to london he had <unk> the little vessel how he had returned how he had <unk> the wall by fastening cramps in the interstices of the stones as he ascended to give him <unk> and how when he had reached the bars he fastened his ladder	184.35560607910156
we can now part come i shall engage your <unk> and you my dear boy i shall stay here for a few days longer we must accustom ourselves to parting	134.4442138671875
but after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of aramis	154.1219940185547
devil take these puritans said mazarin aside they are carved from <unk> then he added aloud but you have relations left you i have one remaining	282.9410095214844
the king is with us and his generals are the duke of orleans and the prince de condé although i must add it is almost impossible now to know to which party any one <unk> yes answered athos but his right place is in our ranks with the prince de conti de beaufort d elbeuf and de bouillon but sir supposing that the conference is broken <unk> you going to try to take charenton such are my <unk> sir since you command the <unk> pardon me i am <unk> so much the better	133.6484832763672
porthos scanned him from head to foot and smiled when he discovered that in spite of the blow he had administered to parry s brother he was not nearly so strong as himself	155.86180114746094
i hastened to you continued beauchamp to tell you albert that in this changing age the faults of a father can not revert upon his children	226.27294921875
i do not know replied dantès	76.27497100830078
dantès rose advanced a few steps and with a fervent prayer of gratitude stretched himself on the granite which seemed to him softer than down	161.64976501464844
aha cried d <unk> they are coming toward <unk> so much the worse for them said porthos	63.65061569213867
it concerns me much said d <unk> since you can not marry madame without my consent and <unk> and since asked the swiss	93.75358581542969
i do not see what you have in your hand said selim	42.122528076171875
thou man of noble heart woe is me	382.10626220703125
the reference is no doubt to the <unk> <unk>	20.270090103149414
edmond said mercédès i have but one word more to say to <unk> the count smiled bitterly	60.200294494628906
it is not just that he should despise me so without any reason	100.99589538574219
what is the matter with you my friend asked the latter	45.18712615966797
besides nobody came thither but the three musketeers they had all been engaged in earnest search and inquiries but had discovered nothing	146.90277099609375
he accepted my challenge and my faith my seventy-five <unk> passed from my pocket to his without reckoning my horse which he won into the bargain	175.18357849121094
all the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten returned he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every word for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere <unk> of words until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven	347.5691223144531
it was her first and on what an occasion	557.2262573242188
dantès saw that he must attack the <unk>	144.6417999267578
at length when they found they were likely to be really in want they got together as a last effort eight or ten <unk> with which porthos went to the gaming table	173.91421508789062
i knew a man who like you had fixed all his hopes of happiness upon a woman	139.4308319091797
franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting-place and from whence his eyes followed the motions of albert and his guides who holding torches in their hands had emerged from a <unk> at the opposite extremity of the colosseum and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the vestal virgins resembling as they glided along some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many <unk> <unk>	255.55593872070312
the <unk> stopped suddenly his knees bent under him and he fell with teresa in his arms	90.15046691894531
all london was crowding to the doors of the house	16.59061050415039
weep said athos weep heart full of love youth and life	629.8845825195312
i mean that all these cries all these complaints these curses produce nothing but storms and flashes and that is all but the lightning will not strike until there is a hand to guide <unk> my friend said <unk> you seem to be a clever and a thoughtful man are you disposed to take a part in a little civil war should we have one and put at the command of the leader should we find one your personal influence and the influence you have acquired over your comrades yes sir provided this war were approved of by the church and would advance the end i wish to <unk> mean the <unk> of my <unk> the war will not only be approved of but directed by the church	251.81690979003906
this day of reunion was the same day as that on which kitty came to find d <unk>	114.97193908691406
go on said the abbé it seems as if i were listening to the story of a dream	60.27006149291992
whom shall i announce said the attendant	94.7593994140625
this child lives and someone knows it <unk> is in possession of our secret and since monte cristo speaks before us of a child disinterred when that child could not be found it is he who is in possession of our <unk> just god avenging god murmured madame <unk>	240.82611083984375
about seven in the morning andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight which played warm and brilliant upon his face	143.7280731201172
well said he in a low voice	3.6808054447174072
oh m. de villefort i beseech your indulgence for <unk> villefort as we have seen belonged to the aristocratic party at marseilles morrel to the plebeian the first was a royalist the other suspected of bonapartism	194.34088134765625
it is true however that it was the shorter and easier part	434.12841796875
she joined her hands with a <unk> air but without venturing to speak a word	82.84439086914062
ah ah said lord de winter after having played comedy after having played tragedy we are now playing melancholy the prisoner made no reply	427.49041748046875
who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him	146.83602905273438
one day the old man fell ill and died	277.4017639160156
oh look at me continued she with a feeling of profound melancholy my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy for the time has long fled since i used to smile on edmond dantès who anxiously looked out for me from the window of yonder garret then inhabited by his old father	331.8429260253906
they sailed edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth and which he had so often dreamed of in prison	111.95278930664062
though mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion when once seated he recovered himself as it were and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of escape	290.90869140625
however i have turned the business over to <unk> so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you for my own part i care nothing about the count or his mysterious <unk> <unk> i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth 32,000 francs wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5,000 francs <unk> he seems to have a mania for diamonds said <unk> smiling and i <unk> believe that like <unk> he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of <unk> them along the road as tom thumb did his flint <unk> perhaps he has discovered some mine said madame <unk>	202.80857849121094
taste this cutlet my dear d <unk> it is off one of my <unk> you have very tender mutton and i wish you joy of <unk> said d <unk>	65.03736877441406
m. de villefort entered followed by barrois	238.6433868408203
it is all one to <unk> us who do not command to-morrow s <unk> chatillon and <unk> looked at each other	112.89590454101562
selim was still at his post and smiled sadly on us as we entered	205.52687072753906
when he reappeared athos received him with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on d <unk> but a more profound tenderness for raoul was now visibly impressed upon his face	130.4207305908203
these words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of la villette	106.56179809570312
there is nothing to do in paris now there is no fronde	134.50909423828125
and she fell on her knees at the same time holding me up towards heaven as if she desired while praying to god in my behalf to raise me actually to his <unk> and for the second time haydée stopped overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance so parched and dry were her throat and lips	272.4377136230469
the devil cried aramis you have a magnificent horse there <unk> yes replied porthos it is the one that ought to have been sent to me at first	63.20960235595703
he was stout had a short thick neck he was attacked with apoplexy and i was called in too late	201.06802368164062
wait he unfolded the paper presented it to the sergeant with one hand and with the other took a pistol from his holsters and cocked it	83.88850402832031

the young man obeyed mounted on the table and divining the wishes of his companion placed his back securely against the wall and held out both hands	107.66932678222656
he fell back cursing with rage	11.947484970092773
it was a <unk> of <unk> s building and with horses and harness for which <unk> had to the knowledge of all the lions of paris refused on the previous day seven hundred guineas	142.86134338378906

monte cristo leaned against a tree and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived looked up and down the avenue examined the passers-by and carefully looked down the neighboring streets to see that no one was concealed	291.6067199707031
pray do not call what i consider the wisest action of my life by such a name	113.30912780761719
d <unk> went successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light but could not find planchet in any of them	99.17444610595703

monsieur said emmanuel have the goodness to address yourself to m. delaunay	116.71623229980469

his warm and <unk> imagination which in gascony had rendered him formidable to young <unk> and even sometimes their mistresses had never dreamed even in moments of delirium of half the amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the least concealed	528.3508911132812

at length they reached the tent lit a lamp and while planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised d <unk> with a trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected letter	167.88226318359375

and we are going to be recompensed for our diligence continued the mercer with a trifling alteration in his <unk> trifling indeed that d <unk> did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary shade which an instant before had darkened the countenance of the worthy man	200.0398712158203
in the meanwhile he looked upon athos as an achilles porthos as an ajax and aramis as a joseph	434.2242736816406
he had <unk> cut out of his old clothes and <unk> cloaks for <unk> and thanks to a very intelligent tailor who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them and whose wife was suspected of wishing to make porthos descend from his aristocratic habits <unk> made a very good figure when attending on his master	323.814697265625
the bell of monte <unk> which only sounds on the pope s decease and the opening of the carnival was ringing a joyous peal	288.32098388671875

pardon me monsieur said d <unk> who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put back m. de <unk> s clock three-quarters of an hour but i thought as it was yet only twenty-five minutes past nine it was not too late to wait upon <unk> twenty-five minutes past nine cried m. de <unk> looking at the clock why that is impossible look rather monsieur said d <unk> the clock shows <unk> that is true said m. de <unk> i believed it later	115.69324493408203
the curtain which had risen at the close of the scene with albert again fell and a rap was heard at the door	150.5154571533203
in that case said he i should lose her and by my own <unk> he dwelt on this idea for a moment then it appeared reality	156.52743530273438

he is of no earthly use to <unk> and you monsieur du vallon is that your advice	109.7380142211914
without reckoning added monte cristo that he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the united states and in england but quite novel in <unk> yes yes i know what you mean <unk> railway of which he has obtained the grant is it not precisely it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that <unk> ten millions	132.22837829589844

quick to the louvre said he to the louvre without losing an instant and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the cardinal	63.982208251953125
he was a fine tall slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty with black eyes and hair as dark as a raven s wing and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger	507.14691162109375
well monsieur he is still <unk> ah <unk> my dear dame said d <unk> springing from his horse and throwing the bridle to planchet you restore me to life where is this dear aramis	92.0487060546875
in spite of this recommendation which owing to the noise could scarcely have been heard two or three musket shots resounded succeeded by a terrible discharge	262.3779602050781
i do not say resumed the guard that <unk> is not a sorcerer but i say that if his prophecy gets wind it is a sure way to prevent it is coming <unk> how so why in this way if <unk> says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape it is plain that the cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will not <unk> good lord said another guard who might have been thought asleep on a bench but who had lost not a syllable of the conversation do you suppose that men can escape their destiny	175.90243530273438

one expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner if i had listened to you lord de winter had said to felton	84.15321350097656
well my dear friend said he in as pure french as has ever been uttered between rouen and tours	250.76318359375
edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the stairs	92.5810317993164
the report of spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was frightened	256.38299560546875

you never knew <unk> eh madame who knows said athos	125.45735931396484
d <unk> examined her with a rapid glance	17.519935607910156

should the king prove a tyrant for power <unk> tyranny serve love respect royalty that divine right that celestial <unk> which makes this dust still powerful and holy so that <unk> nevertheless of rank and <unk> as nothing in comparison with the cold corpse there <unk> i shall adore god sir said raoul respect royalty and ever serve the king	716.22314453125

that is my condemnation thought d <unk> he will spare me the <unk> of the bastille or the tediousness of a trial	105.15470886230469

but come resumed the englishman are these men of yours dangerous in what respect are they capable of attempting violence d <unk> burst out laughing at the idea	393.20587158203125
at length felton who had not yet looked at milady turned toward her	101.59071350097656
mother exclaimed albert just as madame <unk> was descending the stairs let us reckon our riches if you please i want capital to build my plans <unk> <unk> replied mercédès with a mournful smile	153.6802215576172

franz was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host	407.63946533203125
monsieur marechal you must indeed have found yourself in <unk> peril to have undertaken so strange a commission the irony with which these words were uttered did not escape the marechal	377.6740417480469
come do not affect indifference but confess you were pleased to have <unk> oh it is very well as a finish to the toilet	163.05081176757812
what is your business here you hussy d <unk> threw off his hood and disengaged his hands from the folds of the cloak	217.3728790283203
there was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot and also that someone who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard was approaching the spot where he sat	182.21458435058594
let us return to the object that brings me <unk> what that which brings you home to me	117.24263000488281
if she dislikes that so much why did she ever marry herself you do not understand me maximilian	177.95130920410156
it was then albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned aside	222.44285583496094
i then was ready to dismount but it was too late i descended into the arms of the archers	60.85197067260742
the pavilion at nine of the clock d <unk> was at the hôtel des gardes he found planchet all ready	31.93160629272461

nobody but ourselves replied <unk> the fact is we do not lodge <unk> our tavern is so near the town that nobody would think of stopping <unk> then i am afraid i shall very much inconvenience <unk> inconvenience us	189.5747528076172
now madame <unk> feared eugénie s sagacity and the influence of mademoiselle d <unk> she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon debray <unk> expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother s amorous and pecuniary <unk> with the intimate secretary moreover she saw that eugénie detested debray not only because he was a source of <unk> and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once <unk> him in that <unk> of <unk> whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men and whom <unk> designated as animals upon two legs without feathers	364.4640808105469
this noble entrance however in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the <unk> planted in the two vases as they waved their <unk> leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom had fallen into utter <unk>	324.1910400390625
then he added in a low tone yes that is the <unk> and then he again plunged into a train of thought the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile than it would have been by tears	93.09410095214844
so much did this one idea haunt the cardinal even in his sleep that when at seven in the morning <unk> came to arouse him his first words were well what is the matter	225.5088348388672
my friend cried athos suddenly where have you brought us	488.4399108886719
before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye but he who <unk> ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition	1282.65234375

a woman who had been a <unk> beauty a year before he was born could not be the subject of any scheme for him	124.3698501586914
he had therefore purchased a vault which was quickly occupied by members of his family	207.2447509765625

i should never have thought of that said porthos and yet it is very <unk> come aramis said d <unk> write this for us in those neat little characters in which you wrote to marie michon that the mother of this gentleman intended to assassinate the duke of <unk> mordaunt sustained this new attack without wincing	143.58416748046875
the count and ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of spanish wine then monte cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels which enabled him to see into the adjoining room	210.65277099609375
the only thing to mislead the <unk> would have been belief in all the good things he said of himself	111.74462127685547
ho there my friend the wounded man heaved a sigh	89.30928802490234
but the words you have just spoken the hope you have almost given me will have richly paid <unk> it my <unk> oh but i said anne i also duke have had <unk> i also have had dreams	195.70668029785156
the salutation was so well understood that morrel with the same expression in his eyes placed his handkerchief to his mouth and these two living statues whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect separated from each other by the whole length of the room forgot themselves for a moment or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation	227.00230407714844
i never meddle in intrigues and if i occasionally become a confidant of the intrigues of others i am sure your eminence will approve of my keeping them <unk> mazarin shook his head	225.88528442382812
let us not talk about money if you please it is <unk> then you no longer love me said the procurator s wife slowly and sadly	69.37362670898438
<unk> what is it have you confidence in me give your orders said the three musketeers	113.38419342041016
d <unk> had heard the conversation and had understood it	81.53477478027344
i beg your pardon said aramis noticing his awkwardness if i had known that i was to have the honor of your visit i should have procured the gardener s ladder but for me alone this is good <unk> sir said planchet when he saw d <unk> on the summit of the ladder this way is easy for monsieur aramis and even for you in case of necessity i might also climb up but my two horses can not mount the <unk> take them to yonder she would my friend said aramis pointing to a low building on the plain there you will find <unk> and straw for them then come back here and clap your hands three times and we will give you wine and food	160.2525177001953
he could not be mistaken milady was in it	195.8061981201172
<unk> but i remember it perfectly interposed the darling edward	1718.992919921875
<unk> least personally said monte cristo	4.329206943511963
d <unk> and porthos armed with their swords and athos and aramis each carrying a concealed <unk> approached the house which for the time being was charles stuart s prison	186.3971405029297
the enemy was marching upon lens with the intention doubtless of securing possession of that town and separating from france the army of france	291.4832458496094
certainly i was not the first captive that had been shut up in this splendid prison but you may easily comprehend felton that the more superb the prison the greater was my terror	336.3625793457031
had you been in the army you would have been able to pick up a needle on the floor of a closed oven	96.74126434326172
when this was done eugénie opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a <unk> violet silk travelling cloak	446.4836730957031
this evening sir he replied all will be <unk> chapter <unk>	64.7178955078125
i promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty i will be most <unk> severe then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed which seemed to say fear not for your dear sake my justice shall be <unk> with mercy and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return villefort departed with paradise in his heart	302.2300109863281
as he had said on a camp bed dressed in his black doublet booted <unk> with his felt hat beside him lay the king overcome by sleep and fatigue	764.6980590820312
why count exclaimed eugénie what has happened to your ward	228.2531280517578
one of your ancestors had joined the crusades and supposing it to be only that of st. louis that makes you mount to the <unk> century which is tolerably <unk> it is possible said <unk> my father has in his study a genealogical tree which will tell you all that and on which i made commentaries that would have greatly <unk> d <unk> and <unk>	145.6582489013672
it is not your fault my good ali said the count in the arabic language and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing either in voice or <unk> it is not your fault	144.80271911621094
i think so indeed we should be hard to please if we were not	78.68378448486328
then by degrees the reality broke upon me full of chaste terrors	1782.822998046875
finally said felton finally what did they do at length one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he could not conquer	473.7958984375
but after all said lord de winter when the three friends had been named we do not know who you are	33.874229431152344
in the morning at nine of the clock in the day at one of the clock and in the evening at eight	16.16101837158203
so you and the cardinal have been talking about me	151.65126037597656
but peppino instead of answering threw himself on his knees seized the count s hand and covered it with kisses	56.534175872802734
it is the insect with black claws and the awful word which i wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its <unk> go then for in the course of two hours it will be dark and you will not be able to see <unk> <unk> foi you frighten me	85.9272232055664
explain my child he said explain my child he said <unk> did you find this purse in a house in the <unk> de <unk> no	78.04171752929688
this movement was accompanied by killing glances at mademoiselle <unk> and by sighs launched in the same direction	429.873046875
a moment later the <unk> man was beside him	225.85317993164062
all the same resumed he after having <unk> his tongue against his palate they are brave fellows	332.2967529296875
monte cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of morrel who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and workmen	361.1092834472656
then he took away his mother s portrait with its oaken frame leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and empty	503.3224182128906
well my dear father in the <unk> of <unk> life is an eternal <unk> of our <unk> cast into the sea my useless encumbrance that is all and i remain with my own will disposed to live perfectly alone and consequently perfectly <unk> unhappy girl unhappy girl murmured <unk> turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered	347.29595947265625
i am a dead man he said and fell from his horse to the ground	37.22020721435547
come hither i say and do not be afraid continued athos	65.36219787597656
come but where is the doctor exclaimed villefort where is he madame de villefort now deliberately descended the staircase	148.2018585205078
his quiet manner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the mirth of the persons with whom he had been talking and who still remained at the window	76.27279663085938
d <unk> who though wanting in practice had a sound theory redoubled his agility	1560.0167236328125
pardon me d <unk> he said	21.94687843322754
the terrified servants were on the stairs and in the passage where the doctor would pass	60.02507019042969
the horse started brushed against the imprudent man who thought by his strength alone to stay the tempest and he fell against the wall	142.3516845703125
he made fruitless efforts to go on it was impossible	36.43244171142578
the two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall and enclosed the villefort and <unk> coffins	257.6644592285156
he saw me this morning for the first time and has already forgotten he has seen me	43.7286376953125
mademoiselle said he you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your deceased grandmother s room will you allow me the honor of a few minutes conversation with m. <unk> that is it said the old man s eye	83.38401794433594
but what <unk> you done asked franz	119.98455810546875
no <unk> i ask as your unfortunate companion appeared to me to belong to the <unk> he is the curate of bethune sir and was carrying the holy vessels belonging to his church and the treasure of the chapter to a safe place the prince having abandoned our town yesterday and as it was known that bands of the enemy were <unk> about the country no one dared to accompany the good man so i offered to do so	179.56607055664062
but my dear love reflect a little upon what you require of me	290.19293212890625
you are no longer in my service monsieur <unk> oh your excellency your excellency cried the steward struck with terror at this threat if that is the only reason i can not remain in your service i will tell all for if i quit you it will only be to go to the <unk> that is different replied monte cristo but if you intend to tell an <unk> reflect it were better not to speak at <unk> no monsieur i swear to you by my hopes of salvation i will tell you all for the abbé busoni himself only knew a part of my secret but i pray you go away from that <unk>	72.90362548828125
they might have been supposed to be following tracks so <unk> were they wherever they went	321.00164794921875
i your son as you call <unk> will not let you it was the first time d <unk> had ever refused a request from athos	64.5350341796875
fine sport are you still bent on departure athos asked d <unk>	258.0650634765625
<unk> lucien <unk> said albert your punctuality really alarms me	1079.20068359375
that is it is it not monseigneur and i shall have nothing else to do that is it replied the cardinal dryly	66.64598083496094
porthos was resplendent with joy and pride	23.649364471435547
porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall and by the aid of his friend s hand gained the summit	111.07425689697266
it is my father who has just left his <unk> to accompany the doctor to the door added morrel	79.45211791992188
the count stood alone and at a sign from his hand the carriage went on for a short distance	61.330116271972656
but i swear to you before god who hears us that if you betray me and my enemies pardon me i will kill myself while accusing you of my <unk> and <unk> swear to you before god madame said d <unk> that if i am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me i will die sooner than do anything that may compromise <unk> then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the samaritaine	140.33523559570312
in the first place it had been made by a man quite drunk to one who was half drunk and yet in spite of the <unk> which the vapor of three or four bottles of burgundy carries with it to the brain d <unk> when awaking on the following morning had all the words of athos as present to his memory as if they then fell from his <unk> had been so impressed upon his mind	115.87841796875
you lose ground you are turning	481.9053649902344
mercédès and albert were in that room	62.479026794433594
god who knows all knows without doubt but as for me i accuse <unk> oh what an abyss what an abyss cried felton	214.4007568359375
it would be impossible to make use of a diligence equally so to engage <unk> to travel either way a passport was necessary	440.76861572265625
although in reality a liberal he negotiated a loan of six millions for charles x. in 1829 who made him a baron and chevalier of the legion of honor so that he wears the ribbon not as you would think in his <unk> but at his <unk> ah interrupted <unk> laughing beauchamp beauchamp keep that for the <unk> or the <unk> but spare my future father-in-law before me. then turning to monte cristo you just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron i do not know him returned monte cristo but i shall probably soon make his acquaintance for i have a credit opened with him by the house of richard <unk> of london <unk> <unk> of vienna and thomson french at <unk> as he pronounced the two last names the count glanced at maximilian morrel	227.42929077148438
in march there was a question about a grant to a railway	245.2347412109375
follow me said an officer who came up behind the guards	77.27143096923828
the execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your <unk> and <unk> <unk> a slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that charles evinced as he learned these tidings	148.58615112304688
he is preparing a way for your majesty to escape	85.90367126464844
you alone forewarned us of the evil now try and aid us with the <unk> sire said villefort the usurper is detested in the south and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south it would be easy to raise languedoc and provence against <unk> yes assuredly replied the minister but he is advancing by gap and <unk> <unk> is advancing said louis xviii	186.52027893066406
night arrived i allowed it to become quite dark	97.01307678222656
do as you like with your own but do not fill or empty mine	242.8478240966797
aramis confiding in the address of bazin made a pompous <unk> on his <unk>	159.5382537841797
it is true then he said rather uttering his thoughts aloud than addressing his companion it is true then that all our actions leave their <unk> sad others <unk> our paths it is true that every step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the <unk> <unk> leaves its track	398.0245361328125
the count patted him gently on the shoulder his usual mode of praising ali who pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him walked calmly towards a projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house and seating himself <unk> began to smoke his <unk> while monte cristo re-entered his dwelling perfectly assured of the success of his plan	314.0404357910156
making a sign to la <unk> and <unk> to stop he alighted from his horse and went toward these suspected merry companions hoping by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting	183.7969207763672
good day dear d <unk> said aramis believe me i am glad to see <unk> so am i delighted to see you said d <unk> although i am not yet sure that it is aramis i am speaking <unk> to himself my friend to himself	49.879638671875
indeed count you are the most polished man in the world	73.18543243408203
it begins to develop itself said d <unk>	20.35341453552246
my lord i have been so long shut up that i am only of one <unk> am for fresh air	138.88148498535156
as monsieur porthos is a very <unk> man he insists that nobody shall know he has received this wound except the duchess whom he endeavored to interest by an account of his <unk> it is a wound that confines him to his bed ah and a master stroke too i assure you	156.10643005371094
i am <unk> protected in a most wonderful but most terrible manner said he but valentine poor girl how will she bear so much sorrow as he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains	162.50840759277344
the greatest possible <unk> prevailed at court	423.9931945800781
where is he <unk> very ill say you	122.43339538574219
albert followed him with the count	28.666893005371094
oh you may even see her if you like my dear mr. o reilly	146.64443969726562
why is he not here that i may tell him so sir replied monte cristo coldly i did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little family affairs	65.77107238769531
porthos and i will stay <unk> the friends obeyed	207.9038543701172
of course it is of no consequence he added with a <unk> smile	52.4272575378418
that will be the first time i have done so for sixteen <unk> and me too said d <unk>	53.45207595825195
how were you to blame in that affair <unk> one bears an irreproachable name as i do one is rather <unk> everybody <unk> you sir and above all mademoiselle <unk> poor eugénie said <unk> do you know she is going to embrace a religious life no. alas it is unhappily but too true	266.140625
the sweat streamed down his marble forehead and his hand under his coat tore his breast	112.14116668701172
i slept here last night and the night before and you know it is not my custom to sleep three times in the same <unk> then said mordaunt your honor gives me my liberty for to-night and even for all day to-morrow if you want it	90.5297622680664
this letter was read publicly in all parts of the city	107.6869888305664
but you know none are so formal as bankers in <unk> business i intended this money for the charity fund and i seemed to be robbing them if i did not pay them with these precise bonds	447.367431640625
have i not my talent left	1698.6297607421875
in that case we are as well off as we <unk> and yet said porthos i would like to know what grimaud is <unk> silence porthos said aramis	77.7232666015625
d <unk> who had loved him so tenderly loved him still although a <unk>	299.26507568359375
do not condemn it from appearances you will find a horse in the stables quite as good as <unk> the same password <unk> adieu master a good journey gentlemen	180.31752014160156
now one evening when d <unk> who was in the trenches was not able to accompany them athos porthos and aramis mounted on their battle steeds enveloped in their war cloaks with their hands upon their pistol <unk> were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to <unk> following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard as we have stated for fear of an ambuscade when about a quarter of a league from the village of <unk> they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them	133.07089233398438
i will aid you in many ways but without attaching you to my person	425.6579284667969
on this occasion he began his rounds at dantès cell and on leaving him he went on to faria s dungeon taking thither breakfast and some linen	472.9744567871094
d <unk> offered to lower the blinds of the royal carriage but the young king stretched out his arm saying no sir	161.5455780029297
he has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me but he also declared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility of making proposals for another and he never would	115.99075317382812
as for athos they believed him to be dead and left him very quiet on the field of battle not thinking it worth the trouble to carry him away	109.37582397460938
madame <unk> asked me for letters of recommendation for the <unk> i gave her a few lines for the director of the valle theatre who is under some obligation to me	154.89854431152344
and the commencement of the reign of king louis <unk> it may be easily imagined how great was our joy when in turning over this manuscript our last hope we found at the twentieth page the name of athos at the <unk> the name of porthos and at the <unk> the name of aramis	127.13502502441406
and the name of this lord lord de <unk> lord de winter exclaimed the queen the friend of my husband	60.43527603149414
a little <unk> little farther said the other	225.3306121826172

he was nineteen when he entered the château d if he was <unk> when he escaped	38.18336868286133
besides on pressing occasions in extreme difficulties d <unk> would become the preserver of his friends	300.490234375
considering the gravity of the occasion i permit you to speak my friend but be laconic i beg	276.6309814453125
if there had been no bolt it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of st. sebastian encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the famous luigi <unk>	169.5619354248047
all at once he uttered a terrible cry	37.268104553222656
they had traveled onward about half a mile when planchet came close up to d <unk>	164.22811889648438
has not his majesty just left you and has he not himself asked you to prepare for this visit search then monsieur	267.19720458984375
monsieur le lieutenant you have been very prompt	100.85118865966797
no sooner had he turned his back than the officer laid himself down in it and he had scarcely crossed the threshold before his successor in his turn was snoring <unk>	174.9691925048828
you are therefore your own master till seven of the clock in the evening but at seven of the clock you must hold yourself in readiness with two <unk> there said planchet	52.1887321472168
and who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green oh that coat is not his own idea it is the republic s which deputed <unk> to devise a uniform for the <unk> indeed said monte cristo so this gentleman is an academician within the last week he has been made one of the learned <unk> and what is his especial talent his talent	207.429443359375
have you wanted money father i want nothing now that i have you said the old man	50.38007354736328
an awful sadness enveloped the heart of charles	55.22906494140625
i am always prepared to go only as you know i never do go and perhaps shall go this time as little as <unk> in short if i go will you go too i will <unk> you torment me giulio with your fears and what are you afraid of then of many <unk> what are they mazarin s face smiling as it was became clouded	193.73992919921875

ah dantès my friend you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship <unk> then turning towards edmond who was walking away a pleasant journey he cried	230.71629333496094
capital cried the gascon you would make a distinguished <unk> and do you think asked <unk> that stuart will ever escape while i am on guard no to be sure replied d <unk> unless <unk> the sky rains friends upon <unk> <unk> s face brightened	218.22366333007812
even before the coachman had hailed the <unk> the massy gates rolled on their <unk> had seen the count coming and at paris as everywhere else he was served with the rapidity of lightning	300.3128967285156
d <unk> s eyes sparkled with joy	8.188347816467285
i gratify my wishes by two <unk> will and my money	264.9441833496094
dantès struck with the beauty and <unk> of the little vessel applied to its owner to transfer it to him offering sixty thousand francs upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession	224.44442749023438
signor <unk> came to the door to receive his guests	52.6451301574707
it is true that the three others had endeavored to knock the young man down with chairs stools and <unk> but two or three scratches made by the gascon s blade terrified them	404.6546936035156
how can you find out you shall <unk> gaetano consulted with his companions and after five minutes discussion a <unk> was executed which caused the vessel to tack about they returned the way they had come and in a few minutes the fire disappeared hidden by an elevation of the land	241.8946990966797
you are too charming said d <unk> sorrowfully and you abuse my <unk> no i use your generosity that is all	129.29989624023438
oh unfortunate he cried they must have obtained my <unk> the carriage continued to roll on with frightful speed	128.81883239746094

then who <unk> his pistol his <unk> a nubian a <unk> it is he <unk> do you know this gentleman yes and i am come to look for him he is a friend of <unk> oh that is quite another thing then	57.12023162841797
presently it sounded one of the clock	9.726518630981445
but listen they appear to be speaking of me. d <unk> drew near the window and lent his ear	55.67709732055664
at length they entered a path which going out from the road skirted the <unk>	110.0069351196289
i had but one thought and that was that he was observing me	62.752132415771484
my friend is still so kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation which makes my heart glad when i hear <unk> it is an illustrious name said the lieutenant and had one day triumphal honors paid to <unk> what do you mean sir inquired raoul	160.2555694580078
those who were not killed felt the heat of the flames	136.5887451171875
oh would we could relate it everywhere and to everyone so that the emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his <unk> ah really said monte cristo in a <unk> voice	132.64801025390625
at last after traveling two days and a night they arrived at boulogne toward the evening favored by magnificent weather	304.8519592285156
at that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever and when they parted each to take the route agreed on they turned back to utter affectionate expressions which the <unk> of the <unk> repeated	520.2047119140625
he told me he knew nothing about the matter that the orders i had received did not come from him and that if i had the audacity to mention his name as being concerned in this disturbance he would have me hanged	119.25599670410156
now let us lay down the plan of campaign said porthos	116.39332580566406
